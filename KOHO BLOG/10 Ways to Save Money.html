    >When people talk about saving money, you might picture yourself clipping coupons for hours, giving up all your
    little joys (like your morning coffee), or politely declining every invite out with friends. Truth is, it doesn’t
    have to be so extreme. Saving and enjoying life aren’t opposites—they can actually go hand in hand.</span

  <span style="white-space: pre-wrap"
    >Ever found yourself standing in front of the fridge at dinnertime with zero clue what to make? We’ve all been
    there. Often, that’s when we order takeout—not because we’re craving pizza, but because we just don’t have a plan.
    That sort of last-minute spending adds up!</span

  <span style="white-space: pre-wrap"
    >A bit of meal planning goes a long way. Pick your dinners for the week, jot down what you need, and stick to that
    list when grocery shopping. If you can carve out an hour or two on the weekend to prep ingredients—like roasting
    veggies or grilling chicken—you’ll breeze through weeknight dinners and be less tempted by pricey takeout. Bonus:
    home-cooked meals are usually healthier, too.</span
