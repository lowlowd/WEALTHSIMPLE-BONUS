    >In our digital world, we use our cards for just about everything—from our morning coffee run to online shopping and
    booking vacations. While this convenience is great, it also makes us think more about security. Hearing stories
    about fraud can be worrying, and you deserve a financial tool that puts your safety first, giving you control and
    peace of mind.</span

  <span style="white-space: pre-wrap"
    >While traditional banks have security measures in place, they often feel reactive. You find out about a problem
    after it has already happened. What if you could stop fraud in its tracks the moment you suspect something is wrong?
    That's the power behind KOHO's approach to security. As a smart spending and saving account, KOHO is built with
    advanced fraud protection features designed to keep your money safe.</span

</h2>
<p class="text-body font-regular leading-[24px] pb-xxs pt-[9px]" dir="ltr">
  <span style="white-space: pre-wrap"
    >Before we even get to the high-tech features, it’s important to understand how KOHO’s basic structure acts as a
    powerful security tool. Your KOHO account is a reloadable prepaid Mastercard, which means it’s not directly
    connected to your main bank account where you might keep the bulk of your savings.</span
  >
</p>
<p class="text-body font-regular leading-[24px] pb-xxs pt-[9px]" dir="ltr">
  <span style="white-space: pre-wrap"
    >Think of your main bank account as a vault. You want to keep it as secure as possible. Your KOHO account functions
    as your everyday wallet. You can load it with the money you need for the week's groceries, your monthly
    subscriptions, or your travel budget.</span
  >
</p>
<p class="text-body font-regular leading-[24px] pb-xxs pt-[9px]" dir="ltr">
  <span style="white-space: pre-wrap"
    >This separation creates a "firewall" for your finances. In the unlikely event that your KOHO card details are ever
    compromised, a fraudster could only access the funds you’ve loaded onto that card. Your main savings account remains
    untouched and secure. This simple design significantly reduces your risk compared to using a traditional debit card,
    which is directly linked to your entire chequing account balance.</span
