    >Ever caught yourself at the end of the month, scratching your head over where all your money disappeared to? Maybe
    it’s the little spends—a coffee run here, a few online orders there—that slowly drain your balance. Piecing together
    your spending can feel like solving a mystery, especially with old-school banks that just give you endless lines of
    confusing transactions.</span

    KOHO acts more like a friendly guide, showing you what’s happening with your money in real time and giving you the
    tools you need to make better financial choices. With instant alerts, automatic expense sorting, and simple
    budgeting features, KOHO makes it a whole lot easier to understand and control your habits.</span
