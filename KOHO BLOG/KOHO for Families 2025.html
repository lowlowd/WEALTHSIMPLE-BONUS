From tracking grocery bills and paying for kids’ activities to saving for a family vacation or a new home, the list of expenses can feel endless. Traditional banking often adds to the stress with complicated joint accounts, surprise fees, and a lack of tools to help you see where your money is actually going.</span></p><p class="text-body font-regular leading-[24px] pb-xxs pt-[9px]" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">What if you had a financial tool that was built to simplify family finances? Something that could help you track shared expenses, save for common goals, and even reward you for your spending, all without the headaches of a typical bank. That’s exactly what KOHO offers. It’s a smart spending and saving account with a reloadable prepaid Mastercard and a powerful app that can transform how your family manages money together.</span></p><p class="text-body font-regular leading-[24px] pb-xxs pt-[9px]" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">If you’ve ever argued over a mysterious purchase on the bank statement or struggled to save for a big family goal, this guide is for you. Let's explore why KOHO is the perfect financial partner for families in 2025.</span></p><h2 class="font-semibold pdf-heading-class-replace pb-xxs text-h3 leading-[40px] [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:pt-[21px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The Challenge of Family Finances</span></h2><p class="text-body font-regular leading-[24px] pb-xxs pt-[9px]" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Every family’s financial situation is unique, but the challenges are often universal. Keeping track of who spent what, sticking to a household budget, and saving for the future requires teamwork and clear communication. Traditional joint bank accounts can help, but they often fall short. They show you transactions, but they don’t give you the insights you need to make better decisions. You see that money was spent at a supermarket, but you don't have an easy way to track your total grocery spending for the month against your budget.</span></p><p class="text-body font-regular leading-[24px] pb-xxs pt-[9px]" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">KOHO is designed to fill this gap. It’s a transparent, easy-to-use system that gives your family the clarity and control you need to manage your money as a team.</span></p><h2 class="font-semibold pdf-heading-class-replace pb-xxs text-h3 leading-[40px] [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:pt-[21px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Track Your Household Spending with Ease</span></h2><p class="text-body font-regular leading-[24px] pb-xxs pt-[9px]" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">One of the biggest sources of financial stress for families is not knowing where the money goes. Between groceries, gas, kids’ soccer fees, and the occasional pizza night, expenses can add up fast. KOHO brings simplicity and clarity to your household spending.</span></p><ul class="pb-xxs pt-[9px] list-disc pl-5xl pt-[5px]"><li value="1" class="text-body font-regular leading-[24px] my-[5px] [&amp;&gt;ol]:!pb-0 [&amp;&gt;ol]:!pt-0 [&amp;&gt;ul]:!pb-0 [&amp;&gt;ul]:!pt-0" dir="ltr"><b><strong class="font-semibold" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Real-Time Spending Insights:</strong></b><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> When you use your KOHO card, you get an instant notification on your phone. The app automatically categorizes the purchase, so you can see at a glance how much you’re spending on "Groceries," "Transportation," or "Entertainment." This shared visibility helps everyone in the family stay on the same page.</span></li><li value="2" class="text-body font-regular leading-[24px] my-[5px] [&amp;&gt;ol]:!pb-0 [&amp;&gt;ol]:!pt-0 [&amp;&gt;ul]:!pb-0 [&amp;&gt;ul]:!pt-0" dir="ltr"><b><strong class="font-semibold" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">A Clear Picture of Your Budget:</strong></b><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> No more guessing games at the end of the month. The app provides clear, visual summaries of your spending. You can easily see if you’re staying on track with your household budget and identify areas where you might be overspending. This data empowers you to have productive conversations about money and make adjustments as a team.</span></li></ul><p class="text-body font-regular leading-[24px] pb-xxs pt-[9px]" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Imagine knowing exactly how much your family has spent on takeout this month with just a few taps. That’s the kind of powerful insight KOHO provides, helping you make smarter decisions together.</span></p><h2 class="font-semibold pdf-heading-class-replace pb-xxs text-h3 leading-[40px] [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:pt-[21px] [&amp;_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px] [&amp;_a]:underline-offset-[6px]" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Say Goodbye to Family-Draining Bank Fees</span></h2><p class="text-body font-regular leading-[24px] pb-xxs pt-[9px]" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">When you’re trying to save for your family's future, the last thing you need is a bank account that chips away at your savings with unnecessary fees. Many traditional joint accounts come with monthly fees unless you maintain a high minimum balance. On top of that, you can get hit with charges for sending too many e-Transfers or, even worse, a painful non-sufficient funds (NSF) fee if you accidentally overspend.</span></p><p class="text-body font-regular leading-[24px] pb-xxs pt-[9px]" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">KOHO was built to be a family-friendly, fee-free alternative.</span></p><ul class="pb-xxs pt-[9px] list-disc pl-5xl pt-[5px]"><li value="1" class="text-body font-regular leading-[24px] my-[5px] [&amp;&gt;ol]:!pb-0 [&amp;&gt;ol]:!pt-0 [&amp;&gt;ul]:!pb-0 [&amp;&gt;ul]:!pt-0" dir="ltr"><b><strong class="font-semibold" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">No Monthly Fees:</strong></b><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> The standard KOHO account has no monthly maintenance fees. That’s more money that can go toward your family’s goals.</span></li><li value="2" class="text-body font-regular leading-[24px] my-[5px] [&amp;&gt;ol]:!pb-0 [&amp;&gt;ol]:!pt-0 [&amp;&gt;ul]:!pb-0 [&amp;&gt;ul]:!pt-0" dir="ltr"><b><strong class="font-semibold" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">No NSF Fees, Ever:</strong></b><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> Because KOHO is a prepaid system, you can only spend the money you’ve loaded onto the account. This makes it impossible to overdraw and get charged an NSF fee, which can be over $45 per incident at a big bank. It’s a built-in safety net for your family’s budget.</span></li><li value="3" class="text-body font-regular leading-[24px] my-[5px] [&amp;&gt;ol]:!pb-0 [&amp;&gt;ol]:!pt-0 [&amp;&gt;ul]:!pb-0 [&amp;&gt;ul]:!pt-0" dir="ltr"><b><strong class="font-semibold" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Free e-Transfers:</strong></b><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> Need to pay the babysitter or send money to a family member?

What if you could get money back on those essential purchases?</span></p><p class="text-body font-regular leading-[24px] pb-xxs pt-[9px]" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">With a traditional debit card, you get no rewards.
