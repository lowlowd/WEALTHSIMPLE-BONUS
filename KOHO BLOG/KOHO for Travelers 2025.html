    Southeast Asia, exploring European cities, or just taking a weekend road trip across the border, your adventures are
    full of possibilities. But let’s be honest, figuring out the money part can be a major headache. How do you avoid
    expensive fees? How do you stick to a budget in a foreign currency? And how do you keep your money safe while you're
    on the move?</span

    cards that hit them with surprise fees. Thankfully, your wallet has gotten a major upgrade. A new generation of
    financial tools is making it easier, cheaper, and safer to manage your money abroad. At the front of that pack is
    KOHO, a smart spending account with a reloadable prepaid Mastercard and a powerful app.</span

  <span style="white-space: pre-wrap"
    >One of the most frustrating parts of spending money abroad is getting hit with foreign transaction (FX) fees. Most
    traditional credit and debit cards charge you a fee of around 2.5% on every single purchase you make in a different
    currency. It might not sound like much, but it adds up incredibly fast. If you spend $2,000 on your trip, that’s an
    extra $50 you’re paying in fees for no reason—money that could have been spent on a nice dinner or a memorable
    experience.</span
