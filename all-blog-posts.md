- question: 'I opened my account months ago but never funded it. Can I still add a code?'
  answer: 'Yes. If you opened an account but never deposited any money, you are still considered a new client. You can enter a referral code at any time before you fund, or within 7 days of your first deposit.'
- question: 'Can customer support add the code for me if I missed the 7-day window?'
  answer: 'Generally, no. Wealthsimple system is designed to hard-lock the referral option exactly 7 days after your first deposit lands. Customer support typically cannot override this limit.'
- question: 'I clicked a referral link to sign up. Do I still need to enter the code manually?'
  answer: 'Usually no, the link should apply the code automatically. However, verify by checking the Referrals section for a banner saying You were referred by someone. If not visible, enter code 9C6DMQ manually.'
- question: 'Why am I getting an invalid code error?'
  answer: 'This usually happens because you are not a new client (had an old account linked to your email or SIN), or the 7-day window has passed since your first deposit.'
- question: 'I added the code and funded $1. Why have I not received my bonus yet?'
  answer: 'While Wealthsimple aims to pay the $25 bonus within 24 hours, it can sometimes take up to 5-10 business days if verification is needed. Larger bonuses may take up to 14 days.'
- question: 'What if I made a mistake entering my referral code?'
  answer: 'Contact Wealthsimple support to see if they can correct it. This is easier to fix than adding a new code after the window closes.'
- question: 'Will I lose my sign up bonus if I withdraw money?'
  answer: 'If you withdraw funds within 180 days of receiving your bonus, the bonus amount may be deducted from your withdrawal.'

Did you sign up for Wealthsimple but forgot to use a referral code? Don't worry. You might still be able to claim your **Wealthsimple sign up bonus**. This guide covers exactly how to add a referral code after signing upâ€”including the critical time windows you need to know about.

## Can You Add a Referral Code After Signing Up?

**Yes, but it depends on your situation.** If you're searching for a Wealthsimple referral code as an existing client, here's the dealâ€”Wealthsimple has specific rules about when you can and cannot add a referral code retroactively:

| Your Situation                | Can You Add a Code?  |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Account opened, never funded  | âœ… Yes, anytime     |
| Funded within the last 7 days | âœ… Yes, add it now  |
| Funded more than 7 days ago   | âŒ No, window closed |

Let's break down each scenario in detail.

## Scenario 1: You Haven't Funded Your Account Yet

If you've created a Wealthsimple account but haven't made any deposits, **you're in luck**. As an existing client without funding, there's no time limit for adding a referral code to an unfunded account.

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Open the Wealthsimple app** on your phone
2. **Tap the Gift icon** (ðŸŽ) at the top of the home screen
3. Go to the **"Referrals"** tab
4. Look for **"I was referred by someone"** or **"Add a referral code"**
5. Enter the code: **9C6DMQ**
6. Tap **Submit** or **Apply**

Once the code is applied, simply make your first deposit of $1 or more, and you'll receive your **$25 cash bonus** within 24 hours.

ðŸ‘‰ **[Apply code 9C6DMQ and get your bonus](https://wealthsimple.com/invite/9C6DMQ)**

## Scenario 2: You Funded Your Account Within the Last 7 Days

Here's what most people miss: Wealthsimple gives you a **7-day grace period** after your first deposit to add a referral code retroactively.

This window starts from the moment your first dollar lands in your accountâ€”not when you initiated the transfer.

### How to Add a Code During the 7-Day Window:

1. **Open the Wealthsimple app**
2. Go to **Settings** (gear icon)
3. Navigate to **Earn Rewards** or **Referrals**
4. Look for the button that says **"Add a referral code"**
5. Enter: **9C6DMQ**
6. Confirm the submission

### âš ï¸ Important Warning

The "Add a referral code" button **literally disappears** from the app after 7 days. Many users on Reddit have reported searching for this option only to find it gone.

If you can't find the button:

- Check if exactly 7 days have passed since your first deposit _settled_ (not when you initiated the transfer)
- Try logging out and back in to refresh the app
- Update to the latest version of the Wealthsimple app

## Scenario 3: It's Been More Than 7 Days Since Your First Deposit

Unfortunately, if more than 7 days have passed since you funded your account, **you cannot add a referral code**. That's it. This is Wealthsimple's official policy, and even customer support typically cannot override it.

### What Reddit Users Say

Community feedback confirms this is a hard rule:

> _"Tried to contact support after 10 days, they said there's nothing they can do. The system literally won't accept the code."_

> _"The button to add a referral code just isn't there anymore. Wish I'd known about the 7-day thing."_

### Your Options If You Missed the Window

While you can't get the signup bonus, you can still benefit from Wealthsimple in other ways:

1. **Start referring others** â€“ Once you're a client, you get your own referral link and earn $25-$5000 for each friend who signs up
2. **Transfer bonus** â€“ If you transfer $25,000+ from another institution, Wealthsimple reimburses your transfer fees
3. **Tier benefits** â€“ Deposit $100,000+ to unlock Premium status with better rates and lower fees

## Where to Find the "Add Referral Code" Button

The location of this button can vary slightly depending on your app version, but here are the most common places to look:

### Method 1: Gift Icon

- Tap the **Gift icon** (ðŸŽ) at the top of your home screen
- Go to **"Referrals"** tab
- Look for **"I was referred by someone"**

### Method 2: Settings Menu

- Tap your **profile icon** or **Settings** (âš™ï¸)
- Scroll to **"Earn Rewards"** or **"Referrals"**
- Find **"Add a referral code"**

### Method 3: Rewards Section

- Go to **"Rewards"** in the bottom navigation
- Tap **"Referrals"**
- Select **"Enter a code"**

If you've tried all these locations and can't find the option, either:

- Your 7-day window has expired, OR
- You need to update your app to the latest version

## But Why Does Wealthsimple Have This 7-Day Rule?

The 7-day retroactive window exists as a compromise between two goals:

1. **Helping genuine users** who forgot to enter a code during signup
2. **Preventing abuse** where users could wait indefinitely to see if they want to stay before claiming a bonus

This policy is stricter than some competitors but more generous than others (some platforms offer no retroactive option at all).

## Tips to Avoid Missing Your Referral Bonus

For future reference, here's how to ensure you never miss a signup bonus:

### âœ… Use the Direct Link

Instead of manually entering a code, use a referral link like **[wealthsimple.com/invite/9C6DMQ](https://wealthsimple.com/invite/9C6DMQ)**. This automatically applies the code.

### âœ… Verify Before Funding

Before making your first deposit, go to the Referrals section and confirm that a referral code is showing as applied.

### âœ… Screenshot Everything

Take screenshots of the confirmation that a code was applied. This can help if you need to contact support.

### âœ… Fund Immediately

Don't wait too long between signing up and funding. The sooner you deposit, the sooner you get your bonus. A $1 e-trasnfer is the quickest way to get your bonus.

## Ready to Claim Your Wealthsimple Sign Up Bonus?

Still within the 7-day window? Or haven't funded yet? Good. Here's your action plan to claim your sign up bonus:

1. Open the Wealthsimple app now
2. Navigate to the Referrals section
3. Enter code: **9C6DMQ**
4. Make sure you have at least $1 deposited
5. Receive your **$25 cash bonus** within 24 hours

## Frequently Asked Questions

### I opened my account months ago but never funded it. Can I still add a code?

Yes. Wealthsimple distinguishes between "account opening" and "activation." If you opened an account 6 months ago but never deposited a single dollar, you are still considered a new client. You can enter a referral code at any time before you fund, or within 7 days of your first deposit.

### Can customer support add the code for me if I missed the 7-day window?

Generally, no. Wealthsimpleâ€™s system is designed to hard-lock the referral option exactly 168 hours (7 days) after your first deposit lands. Customer support agents typically do not have the ability to override this hard-coded limit, so it is critical to act immediately.

### I clicked a referral link to sign up. Do I still need to enter the code manually?

Usually, noâ€”the link should apply the code automatically. However, to be safe, you should always verify. Open the app, go to the Referrals section (gift icon), and look for a banner that says "You were referred by [Name]." If you don't see it, enter the code 9C6DMQ manually just to be sure.

### Why am I getting an "invalid code" error?

This usually happens for one of two reasons:

1. **You are not a new client:** If you had an old Wealthsimple account (even a closed one) linked to your email or SIN, you are not eligible for a new client bonus.
2. **The 7-day window has passed:** If you funded your account more than 7 days ago, the system will reject any new codes.

### I added the code and funded $1. Why haven't I received my bonus yet?

While Wealthsimple aims to pay the base $25 bonus within 24 hours of funding, it can sometimes take up to 5-10 business days if the system needs to verify your deposit. Larger bonuses (like the $1000 Generation bonus) often take longer to process, typically landing within 14 days after your funding period ends.

### What if I made a mistake entering my referral code?

If you entered an incorrect code that was accepted, you'll need to contact Wealthsimple support to see if they can correct it. This is easier to fix than adding a new code after the window closes.

### Will I lose my sign up bonus if I withdraw money?

If you withdraw funds within 180 days of receiving your Wealthsimple sign up bonus, the bonus amount may be deducted from your withdrawal.

## Quick Tier Overview

| Feature                | Core ($0-$99K)  | Premium ($100K+)   | Generation ($500K+) |
| ---------------------- | --------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| **Management Fee**     | 0.50%           | 0.40%              | 0.20%-0.40%         |
| **Cash Interest**      | 1.25%           | 1.75%              | 2.25%               |

## Core Tier ($0 - $99,999)

The **Core** tier is where everyone startsâ€”and honestly, it's pretty solid on its own. Here's what you get when you're just starting out or building up your portfolio:

### What You Get

**Stock & ETF Trading:**

- $0 commission on all Canadian stocks and ETFs
- $0 commission on US stocks and ETFs (with FX caveat)

**Managed Investing:**

- 0.50% annual management fee
- Automatic rebalancing and dividend reinvestment

**Banking:**

- 1.25% interest on Chequing balance
- Can boost to 1.75% with $2,000+/month direct deposit

**Crypto:**

- 2% trading fee per transaction
- Access to major cryptocurrencies

### The Hidden Cost: USD Trading

Okay, here's the catch for Core usersâ€”there's a **1.5% currency conversion fee** every time you touch US stocks.

**Example:** Buying $10,000 of Apple stock:

- FX fee: $150 (buy) + $150 (sell) = **$300 round-trip cost**

The workaround? The **USD Account** for $10/month, which lets you hold USD and avoid per-trade conversion.

For someone trading US stocks monthly, this makes sense:

- Without USD Account: $300+ per trade in FX fees
- With USD Account: $120/year flat fee

### Is Core Good Enough?

**Yes, if you:**

- Only invest in Canadian stocks and ETFs
- Have less than $100K in total assets
- Don't actively trade US equities

**No, if you:**

- Frequently trade US stocks
- Have approaching $100K and want lower fees
- Want higher interest on cash

## Premium Tier ($100,000+)

**Premium** is really the "sweet spot" for serious investors in Canada. Hit $100,000 in net deposits across all your Wealthsimple accounts, and you'll unlock these upgrades automatically.

### What Changes at Premium

**Free USD Account:**

- Saves $120/year immediately
- More importantly, eliminates the need to convert on every US trade

**Lower Management Fee:**

- Drops from 0.50% to 0.40%
- Saves $100/year on a $100,000 portfolio

**Higher Cash Interest:**

- Base rate: 1.75% (vs 1.25%)
- With direct deposit: up to 2.25%

**Reduced Crypto Fees:**

- Trading fee drops from 2% to 1%
- Staking reward cut reduced from 30% to 20%

**Better Options Pricing:**

- Per-contract fee drops from $2 to $0.75 USD

**Priority Support:**

- Faster email and phone response times

### Is Premium Worth It at $100K?

Let's do the math for a typical $100K portfolio:

| Benefit                                | Annual Value |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Management fee savings (0.1% Ã— $100K) | $100         |
| Free USD Account                       | $120         |
| Higher cash interest (on $5K cash)     | ~$25         |
| **Total Annual Savings**               | **~$245**    |

**Our take: Premium is absolutely worth it at $100K.** The benefits kick in automaticallyâ€”you don't have to do anything once you hit the threshold. For most Canadians investing in US stocks, the free USD account alone pays for itself.

If you're close to $100K, consider consolidating accounts to reach Premium faster.

## Generation Tier ($500,000+)

**Generation** is Wealthsimple's answer to private banking. It targets high-net-worth individuals who might otherwise use full-service wealth managers.

### What Changes at Generation

**Lowest Fees Possible:**

- Management fee: 0.40% at $500K, scaling down to 0.20% at $10M+
- That's $1,000-$2,000 saved annually on a $500K portfolio

**Maximum Cash Interest:**

- 2.25% base rate (highest tier)
- Additional 0.5% boost with direct deposit = up to 2.75%

**Lowest Crypto Fees:**

- Trading fee: 0.5%
- Staking reward cut: 15%

**Private Asset Access:**

- Private credit funds
- Private equity investments
- **Summit Portfolio** â€” Wealthsimple's flagship offering for Generation clients, combining public and private assets in a single managed portfolio
- Previously only available to institutional investors with $1M+ minimums

**Lifestyle Perks:**

- 50% off Medcan health plans
- Partner rewards (Uber One, Strava Premium, etc.)
- Dedicated financial advisor access
- Estate planning services

**Credit Card Benefits:**

- Wealthsimple Visa Infinite annual fee waived ($240/year value)

### Is Generation Worth Pursuing?

If you're naturally growing to $500K through investing, the benefits are automatic and significant.

**Actively chasing $500K just for Generation status?** That depends:

- Don't move money into worse investments just to hit the threshold
- The math: $500K Ã— 0.1% fee savings = $500/year
- Combined with other perks, Generation clients save $1,000+ annually

## Side-by-Side Fee Comparison

### For a $100K Portfolio

| Cost Category           | Core    | Premium | Difference |
| ----------------------- | ------- | ------- | ---------- |
| Management (robo)       | $500/yr | $400/yr | -$100      |
| USD Account             | $120/yr | $0      | -$120      |
| Cash Interest (on $10K) | $125    | $175    | +$50       |
| **Net Difference**      | â€”     | â€”     | **-$170**  |

### For a $500K Portfolio

| Cost Category                 | Premium   | Generation  | Difference |
| ----------------------------- | --------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Management (robo)             | $2,000/yr | $2,000/yr\* | $0         |
| Cash Interest (on $25K)       | $437      | $562        | +$125      |
| Crypto fees (on $10K trading) | $100      | $50         | -$50       |
| Credit Card fee               | $240      | $0          | -$240      |
| **Net Difference**            | â€”       | â€”         | **-$165**  |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I combine assets with my spouse to reach Generation status?

Yes. Wealthsimple allows you to create a "Household" by linking your profile with a partner. Their system combines your total assets to calculate your tier. For example, if you have $300,000 and your partner has $200,000, you will both be upgraded to Generation status and unlock the 2.25% interest rate and other perks.

### If the market drops my balance below $100k, do I lose Premium status?

Wealthsimple generally protects you from market downturns. Your status is determined by net deposits OR total portfolio valueâ€”whichever is higher. If you deposit $100,000 and the market drops your value to $90,000, you typically maintain Premium status. You usually only risk downgrading if you withdraw funds that drop your net deposits below the threshold.

### Do I have to pay the $10 USD fee for each account separately?

No. If you are a Core client paying for the USD account subscription ($10/month), that single fee covers all your eligible accounts (TFSA, RRSP, and Non-Registered). You do not need to pay per account. If you are Premium or Generation, this fee is waived entirely for all accounts.

### Is my money locked in if I invest in Private Credit or Private Equity?

Yes, these assets have different liquidity rules than stocks. Unlike ETFs which can be sold instantly during market hours, Private Credit and Private Equity funds typically have specific monthly or quarterly "redemption windows." In times of high market stress, there may be limits on how much can be withdrawn at once.

### Do Generation clients still get DragonPass lounge access?

Yes, but it is part of the "Milestone Rewards" system. Once you reach the required asset level, you can select the 10 DragonPass lounge visits as your reward for the year. This is separate from any lounge access provided by the Wealthsimple Visa Infinite Privilege card.

### Does TFSA + RRSP + Chequing all count toward tier status?

Yes. All Wealthsimple accounts are combined when calculating your tier.

### Do referral bonuses count toward tier qualification?

The Wealthsimple sign up bonus itself is cash, not "deposits" for tier purposes. However, any funds you deposit to receive the bonus do count toward your tier status.

- question: 'Is a Wealthsimple promo code better than a referral code?'
  answer: 'For most users, the referral code is the easiest option. You get a guaranteed $25 cash bonus with just a $1 minimum deposit. Promo codes offering devices like iPhones require $100K+ deposits and 2-year commitments.'
- question: 'What is the best Wealthsimple sign up bonus right now?'

  answer: 'Yes, Corporate accounts are eligible for referral bonuses. The bonus is typically deposited into a personal non-registered account rather than the corporate account.'

  answer: 'No. The standard referral code is ideal for students because it requires only a $1 minimum deposit to trigger the cash bonus.'
- question: 'Is there a limit to how many friends I can refer?'
  answer: 'No. There is currently no limit to the number of people you can refer to Wealthsimple.'
- question: 'I signed up but never funded my account. Can I still add a code?'
  answer: 'Yes. If your account has remained unfunded, you can add a code anytime. The 7-day deadline only begins after your first deposit.'

If you've been poking around looking for Wealthsimple bonuses, you've probably noticed two different things floating around: **promo codes** and **referral codes**. Are they the same? Can you use both at once? And which one's actually worth your time?

Let's clear this up once and for all.

## Quick Comparison: Promo Code vs Referral Code

| Feature             | Promo Code                              | Referral Code               |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Source**          | Wealthsimple marketing campaigns        | Existing Wealthsimple users |
| **Typical Reward**  | Devices (iPhone, AirPods) or bonus cash | Cash ($25 - $5,000)         |
| **Minimum Deposit** | Usually $100,000+                       | Just $1                     |
| **Availability**    | Limited time only                       | Always available            |
| **Stackable**       | Usually not                             | Usually not                 |
| **Best For**        | High-net-worth investors                | Everyone                    |

## What Is a Wealthsimple Promo Code?

A **promo code** (sometimes called a promotional code or campaign code) is basically Wealthsimple running a marketing campaign. Here's the deal with these:

- Run for limited periods (often 4-8 weeks)
- Offer alternative rewards like devices or enhanced cash bonuses
- Typically have higher funding requirements
- Are promoted through official Wealthsimple channels

### Examples of Wealthsimple Promotional Campaigns

#### The Apple Promotion (November-December 2025)

- **Reward:** Latest iPhone or MacBook
- **Requirement:** Net funding of $100,000 - $500,000
- **Duration:** Limited time during holiday season
- **Registration:** Specific landing page required

#### Wealthsimple iPhone Promotion vs Referral Bonus

- **Reward:** Latest iPhone model
- **Requirement:** Usually $100,000+ deposit
- **Target:** Mass affluent investors considering a platform switch
- **Trade-off:** You must maintain $100,000 deposit for upwards of 2 years!

#### New WealthsimpleClient Referral Code

- **Reward:** Enhanced cash bonus (sometimes $50+ instead of $25 can go up to $5,000)
- **Requirement:** Standard funding requirements
- **Duration:** Short promotional windows
- **Holding period:** You must maintain bonus deposit for 6 months!There is some flexibility with withdrawal up to 5%.

### How Promo Codes Work

1. Visit Wealthsimple's promotional landing page
2. Register specifically through that campaign
3. Meet the higher funding thresholds
4. Receive the promotional reward instead of standard referral bonus

## How to Find Legitimate Wealthsimple Promo Codes

Searching for "Wealthsimple promo code" on Google? Yeah, it can get messy out there. Here's how to find the real deals and avoid wasting your time:

### Official Sources (Always Check First)

1. **Wealthsimple's Promotions Page** â€” The official [promotions.wealthsimple.com](https://promotions.wealthsimple.com) lists all current campaigns
2. **Wealthsimple's Newsletter** â€” Subscribers often get early access or exclusive promo codes
3. **In-App Notifications** â€” Existing users sometimes see targeted promotions within the app

### Secondary Sources (Use Caution)

- **Reddit (r/PersonalFinanceCanada)** â€” Real user discussions, but verify any codes mentioned
- **Financial Blogs** â€” Some may have partnerships, others may be outdated
- **Coupon Sites** â€” Often unreliable for financial products; Wealthsimple rarely uses generic coupon codes

### Red Flags to Watch For

âš ï¸ **Unrealistic promises** â€” "Get $500 with just $1" (the referral ladder requires higher deposits for bigger bonuses)

âš ï¸ **No official source** â€” If you can't find the promo on Wealthsimple's website, it's likely fake or expired

âš ï¸ **Requests for personal info** â€” Legitimate codes never require you to share information outside Wealthsimple's platform

The bottom line? For guaranteed, always-available value, **referral codes beat promo hunting** for most investors.

## Wealthsimple Promo Code History: What Worked in 2025

Understanding past promotions helps you anticipate future opportunities and evaluate current offers:

### Q4 2025: Holiday Season Promotions

- **Apple Promotion (Nov-Dec):** iPhone 17 or MacBook for $100K-$500K deposits
- **New Client Boost:** Enhanced $50 referral bonuses during Black Friday
- **Credit Card Referral Challenge:** Bonuses for new Wealthsimple card signups

### Q2-Q3 2025: Summer Campaigns

- **Transfer Bonus Boost:** Higher bonuses for RRSP/TFSA transfers from Big Five banks
- **Crypto Volume Pricing:** Reduced fees for active crypto traders (not technically a promo code, but a promotional offer)

### Patterns to Watch

| Season            | Typical Promo Type    | Target Audience          |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| January-February  | RRSP deadline promos  | Tax-season investors     |
| April-May         | Tax refund campaigns  | First-time investors     |
| November-December | Premium device offers | High-net-worth transfers |

If you're planning a large transfer, timing it around these promotional windows could maximize your total value. Otherwise, the referral code is available year-round.

## What Is a Wealthsimple Referral Code?

A **referral code** comes from an existing Wealthsimple user and connects you to their account. When you use their code:

- You get a **$25 cash bonus** (flat rate for new users)
- They get a corresponding bonus (which can scale up to $5,000 based on your deposit size)
- Once you're a member, you can earn bigger bonuses by referring others through the referral ladder

### Current Referral Code: 9C6DMQ

ðŸ‘‰ **[Use referral code 9C6DMQ](https://wealthsimple.com/invite/9C6DMQ)** â€“ Get $25 with just a $1 deposit.

### How Referral Codes Work

1. Click a referral link or manually enter the code during signup
2. Deposit at least $1 within 30 days
3. Receive your $25 cash bonus within 24 hours
4. Once you're a member, you can refer others and earn up to $5,000 in bonuses yourself

## Can You Stack Promo Codes and Referral Codes?

**Good news: YES, you typically CAN stack them!** Wealthsimple's recent promotional terms specifically allow the Referral Bonus ($25) to be combined with Transfer Promotions like the iPhone or MacBook offers.

### How Stacking Works

1. **Enter the referral code first** â€” Add code 9C6DMQ in your account settings to qualify for the $25 sign-up bonus
2. **Register for the transfer promotion** â€” Then register through the promotional landing page for the iPhone/device offer
3. **Complete the deposit requirements** â€” Your $100K+ deposit qualifies you for the device while the referral code gets you $25 cash

The key rule is that the **same net deposits cannot count toward two separate transfer-based promotions**. But since the referral bonus only requires $1 to activate, and the iPhone promotion requires $100K+, they're not competing for the same funds.

### What You Can Stack

| Combination                                | Stackable? | Notes                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Referral code + iPhone promo               | âœ… Yes    | Enter referral code first, then register for iPhone     |
| Referral code + Transfer bonus             | âœ… Yes    | Referral activates with $1, transfer bonus counts total |
| Referral code + Transfer fee reimbursement | âœ… Yes    | Always stackable                                        |
| iPhone promo + Another transfer promo      | âŒ No      | Same funds can't trigger two promos                     |

## So Which Should You Actually Choose?

### Go With the Referral Code If:

âœ… You're depositing less than $100,000

- Promo campaigns typically require $100K+ to get device rewards
- The referral code works with just $1

âœ… You want guaranteed cash

- Referral bonuses are always cash
- Promo rewards might be devices you don't need

âœ… You don't want to wait for promotions

- Referral codes are always available
- Promo campaigns come and go

âœ… You value simplicity

- Referral process is straightforward
- Promo campaigns sometimes have complex registration requirements

### Choose a Promo Code If:

âœ… You're depositing $100,000+

- The math on device promotions starts to make sense at higher amounts

âœ… You specifically want the promotional reward

- If you need a new iPhone and were going to buy one anyway, getting it "free" can be worthwhile

âœ… You've already used a referral code before

- If you're somehow not eligible for the referral bonus, a promo might be your only option

## The Math: When Promo Codes Make Sense

Let's calculate when choosing a promo over a referral makes financial sense:

### Scenario: $100,000 Deposit

| Option        | Reward        | Cash-Equivalent Value |
| ------------- | ------------- | --------------------- |
| Referral Code | $500 cash     | $500                  |
| iPhone Promo  | Latest iPhone | ~$1,500 retail        |

**Winner: Promo code** (if you'll actually use the iPhone)

### Scenario: $150,000 Deposit

| Option        | Reward        | Cash-Equivalent Value |
| ------------- | ------------- | --------------------- |
| Referral Code | $500 cash     | $500                  |
| iPhone Promo  | Latest iPhone | ~$1,500 retail        |

**Winner: Promo code** (still makes sense)

### Scenario: $50,000 Deposit

| Option        | Reward               | Cash-Equivalent Value |
| ------------- | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| Referral Code | $200 cash            | $200                  |
| Promo Code    | Usually not eligible | $0                    |

**Winner: Referral code** (promo requires higher minimum)

## Current Promotions vs Referral Code

As of December 2025, here's how current known promotions stack up:

| Promotion       | Reward                  | Min. Deposit      | Referral Alternative |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| iPhone Promo    | Latest iPhone (~$1,500) | $100,000          | $500 cash            |
| Apple Promotion | Device varies           | $100,000-$500,000 | $500-$1,500 cash     |
| Referral Code   | Cash                    | $1                | â€”                  |

For most users, the **referral code remains the best choice** because:

1. No minimum deposit beyond $1
2. Cash is more flexible than devices
3. No need to time a promotional window
4. The referral ladder still offers substantial bonuses for large deposits

### Hold Period: The "Hidden" Difference

One of the most critical differences between these two options is how long your money must stay in the account. This is often buried in the fine print but can lock up your funds for years.

| Feature             | Referral Code (Cash Bonus) | Promo Code (Device/iPhone)       |
| :------------------ | :------------------------- | :------------------------------- |
| **Bonus Value**     | $25 - $5,000               | ~$1,000+ (Device value)          |
| **Minimum Deposit** | $1                         | $100,000+                        |
| **Hold Period**     | **180 Days (6 Months)**    | **365 Days - 2 Years**           |
| **Flexibility**     | 5 % Liquid until 180 days  | Locked in for 365 days - 2 years |
| **Penalty**         | Bonus amount clawed back   | Full device cost charged         |

**Key Takeaway:** If you take the iPhone promo, that $100,000+ is effectively "locked" for at least a year. If you need to withdraw it for a down payment or emergency, you will be billed for the full cost of the phone. Referral bonuses typically follow a standard 180-day retention period.

## Final Recommendation

For the average Canadian opening a Wealthsimple account:

**Use a referral code.** Seriouslyâ€”it's simpler, it's always there, and you get cash you can do whatever you want with.

ðŸ‘‰ **[Sign up with referral code 9C6DMQ](https://wealthsimple.com/invite/9C6DMQ)** and get your $25+ bonus.

Now, if you're moving $100K+ and there happens to be a device promo running that you actually want? Sure, crunch the numbers. But for 95% of Canadians, the referral code wins.

## Promo Codes and Wealthsimple Tiers: What to Know

Here's something worth thinking aboutâ€”your choice between promo codes and referral codes can also affect which Wealthsimple tier you land in:

### How Tiers Work

| Tier           | Net Deposits | Key Benefits                                       |
| -------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Core**       | $0 - $99,999 | Standard features, 1.5% FX fee on USD              |
| **Premium**    | $100,000+    | Free USD account, lower management fees            |
| **Generation** | $500,000+    | Lowest fees, private asset access, lifestyle perks |

### Strategic Considerations

**If you're close to Premium ($100K):**
The referral ladder gives you $500 cash at $100K. A promo code might give you an iPhone (~$1,500 value). The promo wins on raw value, but the cash bonus is more flexible.

**If you're targeting Generation ($500K):**
At this level, the referral ladder pays $1,500 cash. If a MacBook promo is running (~$2,000+ value), the promo might edge out the referral bonusâ€”but only if you actually need a MacBook.

**Important:** Both promo rewards and referral bonuses are deposited as cash or value to your account, but neither counts as "net deposits" for tier calculation. Your actual deposited funds determine your tier.

## Real User Experiences: What Canadians Are Actually Saying

We spend way too much time on Reddit and Canadian finance forums. Here's what real users report about these codes:

### On Referral Codes

> _"Used a referral code, deposited $50K from my TD TFSA, got $200 bonus plus they covered my $150 transfer fee. Total win."_ â€” r/PersonalFinanceCanada user

> _"The $1 minimum to get $25 is honestly unbeatable. Just do this even if you're not sure about the platform."_ â€” r/Wealthsimple user

### On Promo Codes

> _"Got the iPhone 17 promo for transferring my $150K RRSP. Took about 6 weeks for the phone to arrive after my transfer settled."_ â€” r/PersonalFinanceCanada user

> _"Missed the promo deadline by 2 days. Support couldn't do anything. Should have just used a referral code from the start."_ â€” r/Wealthsimple user

The consensus? Referral codes are reliable and immediate. Promo codes can offer higher value but require timing and higher deposits.

## Tax Implications of Promo and Referral Bonuses

A frequently overlooked aspect of both promo and referral rewards:

### Cash Bonuses (Referral Codes)

- Deposited to your **Wealthsimple Chequing account** (not registered accounts)
- Wealthsimple does **not** issue T4A tax slips for these bonuses
- You may be responsible for reporting the income, depending on your situation

### Device Rewards (Promo Codes)

- Generally treated as promotional gifts, not taxable income
- Consult a tax professional if receiving high-value items

### Why Bonuses Go to Chequing

If bonuses were deposited to your TFSA or RRSP, they would consume contribution room. By defaulting to the Chequing account, Wealthsimple avoids this complication entirely.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use both a promo code and referral code?

Generally, no. You must choose one entry method when signing up. The same funds cannot trigger both bonuses.

### Do promo codes expire?

Yes. Promotional campaigns run for limited periods (typically a few weeks to a few months). Referral codes are always available.

### How long do I have to keep my money in Wealthsimple?

This is the most important difference to check. Referral bonuses generally require you to keep your bonus and net deposits in the account for **180 days (6 months)**. Promo codes for devices (like an iPhone) often require you to maintain your balance for **1 year or even 2 years** depending on the specific terms.

### Is a Wealthsimple promo code better than a referral code?

For deposits under $100K, the referral code is almost always better (guaranteed cash with just $1 minimum). For deposits over $100K, compare the promo device value to the referral ladder cash bonus.

### What's the best Wealthsimple sign up bonus right now?

For most Canadians, the referral code offering $25-$5,000 in cash (based on deposit size) is the best option. It requires just $1 minimum and is always available.

### Can I refer my spouse or partner living at the same address?

Yes. Wealthsimple permits referrals between members of the same household. As long as your spouse or partner is a new client (meaning they have never held a Wealthsimple account before), you can send them your referral link. Once they fund their account, you will both receive the applicable cash bonus.

### Can I use a referral code when opening a Corporate Account?

Yes, Corporate accounts are eligible for referral bonuses. If you are opening a new Corporate Managed or Self-Directed account, you can apply a code. Note that Wealthsimple typically deposits referral bonuses into a personal non-registered account (like Wealthsimple Cash) rather than the corporate account itself to simplify tax reporting.

### Is there a specific Wealthsimple promo code for students?

Typically, no. Wealthsimple does not offer exclusive "student" codes. However, the standard referral code is ideal for students because it requires only a $1 minimum deposit to trigger the cash bonus. This is much more accessible than seasonal promo codes which often require deposits of $100,000+.

### Is there a limit to how many friends I can refer?

No. There is currently no limit to the number of people you can refer to Wealthsimple.

### I signed up a while ago but never funded my account. Can I still add a code?

Yes. If your account has remained unfunded. The strict 7-day deadline to add a code only begins after you make your first deposit. Look for the "Add a referral code" button in the gift/rewards section of the app.

Before claiming your Wealthsimple sign up bonus, it's important to understand the terms and conditions. This guide breaks down the fine print in plain English so you know exactly what to expect from your referral bonus.

## Eligibility Requirements

### Who Can Receive a Referral Bonus?

To qualify for the **Wealthsimple sign up bonus** of $25 (or higher tier), you must meet ALL of the following criteria:

| Requirement            | Details                                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **New Client Status**  | Never opened a Self-directed, Crypto, Managed Investing, or Chequing account |
| **Canadian Residency** | Must be a legal resident of Canada                                           |
| **Age of Majority**    | Must be 18+ (19+ in some provinces)                                          |
| **Account Standing**   | Must be able to pass identity verification                                   |

### What Counts as a "New Client"?

Wealthsimple's definition of "new" is **absolute**. If you've ever:

- Opened and closed a Wealthsimple account
- Signed up for Wealthsimple Tax only
- Started registration but never funded

...you may or may not qualify depending on how far you got in the process. Generally, if you completed identity verification for any investment product, you're not considered new.

> **Exception:** Some users who signed up years ago and never engaged may receive "reactivation" offers with different terms.

## Funding Requirements

### Minimum Deposit: Just $1

One of the most attractive aspects of Wealthsimple's referral program is the **$1 minimum deposit**. Unlike competitors who require $100 or more, Wealthsimple makes it accessible to everyone.

### 30-Day Funding Window

You must fund your account within **30 days** of:

- Entering the referral code, OR
- Opening your account (AND if the code was applied during signup)

If you miss this window, the referral relationship expires and no bonus is paid to either party.

> **Exception:** If you're doing an institutional transfer (RRSP, TFSA, LIRA from another bank), you get a **90-day window** instead. This accounts for the fact that bank-to-bank transfers can take 2-4 weeks.

### Where Can the Deposit Go?

Your qualifying deposit can go into any of these account types:

- âœ… Self-directed Trading account
- âœ… Managed Investing (robo-advisor)
- âœ… Crypto account
- âœ… Chequing account
- âœ… TFSA, RRSP, FHSA, or other registered accounts

## Bonus Payment Details

### When You'll Receive Your Bonus

Most users receive their referral bonus within **24 hours** of making a qualifying deposit. In rare cases, it may take up to a few business days.

### Where the Bonus Is Deposited

Your bonus is deposited into your **Wealthsimple Chequing account**, not your investment account.

**Why?** This is intentional. If the bonus went into your TFSA or RRSP, it would count as a contribution and use up your contribution room. By depositing it into Chequing:

- No contribution room is affected
- You can access it immediately
- You can move it wherever you want

> **Important:** If you don't have a Chequing account open, Wealthsimple may give you a grace period (typically 30-90 days) to open one. Otherwise, you might not receive your bonus.

### The 180-Day Hold Period

Here's a critical detail many people miss: **you must keep the bonus in your Wealthsimple account for 180 days**.

What happens if you withdraw early?

- The bonus amount may be **deducted from your withdrawal**
- This applies even if you're withdrawing from a different account than where the bonus was deposited

**Example:** You receive a $25 bonus in your Chequing account but later withdraw $500 from your TFSA within 180 days. Wealthsimple may deduct $25 from that withdrawal.

## Referral Ladder Bonuses

For deposits larger than $1,000, additional bonus tiers apply:

| Deposit Amount        | Total Bonus |
| --------------------- | ----------- |
| $1 â€“ $999           | $25         |
| $1,000 â€“ $9,999     | $50         |
| $10,000 â€“ $49,999   | $100        |
| $50,000 â€“ $99,999   | $200        |
| $100,000 â€“ $499,999 | $500        |
| $500,000 â€“ $999,999 | $1,500      |
| $1,000,000+           | $5,000      |

### Extended Funding Period for Transfers

If you're transferring assets from another institution, you get extra time:

- **Standard deposits:** 30 days
- **Institutional transfers:** Up to 90 days

This accommodation exists because bank transfers can take 2-4 weeks to complete, and Wealthsimple doesn't want you penalized for your old bank's slow processing.

## Tax Implications

### No Tax Slips Issued

Wealthsimple **does not issue tax slips** (like T4A) for referral bonuses. However, this doesn't mean the income is tax-free.

### Your Reporting Responsibility

Technically, referral bonuses may be considered taxable income. Whether you need to report it depends on:

- Your overall tax situation
- The total amount received
- Whether you're treating it as casual income or part of a business

Most individual users receiving one-time $25 bonuses don't report them separately, but consult a tax professional if you're earning significant amounts through referrals.

### Why Bonuses Go to Chequing, Not TFSA

If your $25 bonus was deposited directly into your TFSA, it would:

- Count as a contribution
- Use up $25 of your contribution room
- Potentially cause over-contribution if you're near your limit

By depositing to Chequing, Wealthsimple avoids this problem entirely.

## Disqualification Scenarios

Your referral may be rejected if:

| Scenario                                              | Result                         |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Previously opened any Wealthsimple investment account | Ineligible                     |
| Failed identity verification                          | No bonus until resolved        |
| Funded after 30-day window                            | Referral expires               |
| Attempted to refer yourself                           | Both accounts may be suspended |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What if I withdraw my original deposit but leave the bonus?

If you try to withdraw any funds (even your original deposit) within 180 days, the bonus may be deducted.

### Is there a limit to how many people I can refer?

No. Once you're a Wealthsimple client, you can refer unlimited friends and earn at least $25 for each successful referral.

### Is the Wealthsimple sign up bonus worth it?

Absolutely. For a $1 minimum deposit, you get $25 in free cashâ€”that's an instant 2,500% return. If you're transferring larger amounts, the bonus scales up to $5,000, making it one of the best sign up bonuses in Canadian fintech.

### Do I get a T5 or T4A slip for my referral bonus?

No. Wealthsimple generally does not issue tax slips (like a T5 or T4A) for referral bonuses paid into non-registered accounts (like your Cash account). However, this does not mean the income is tax-free; you are still responsible for reporting it to the CRA as "other income" if required.

### Will I lose my bonus if my portfolio drops below the deposit requirement?

Generally, no. Wealthsimple's clawback policy applies to withdrawals, not market performance. If you deposit the required funds and the market value drops, you typically keep your bonus. You only risk losing it if you actively withdraw funds that bring your net deposits below the threshold during the hold period.

### Who gets the bonus if I open a Spousal RRSP?

In a Spousal RRSP, the primary account holder (the person making the contributions) is considered the client for the referral program. They must be the one to enter the referral code and meet the funding requirements to earn the bonus.

### Is there a special Wealthsimple referral code for students?

No. However, the standard referral code (9C6DMQ) is highly recommended for students because it triggers the $25 cash bonus with a minimum deposit of only $1. This low barrier to entry makes it accessible even on a student budget.

### I have a TFSA. Can I use a code if I open a new RRSP?

No. The referral program is strictly for new clients who have never had a Wealthsimple account before. If you already hold any Wealthsimple account (including Cash, Crypto, or Tax), opening a secondary account type (like an RRSP) does not make you eligible for a new client referral bonus.

Most people know about Wealthsimple's standard $25 referral bonus, but did you know you can earn up to **$5,000** for a single referral? The **Referral Ladder Challenge** offers tiered Wealthsimple sign up bonuses based on how much you depositâ€”making it one of the most lucrative fintech referral programs in Canada.

## What Is the Referral Ladder Challenge?

The Referral Ladder Challenge is Wealthsimple's tiered bonus structure that scales your reward based on your net funding amount. The more you deposit, the bigger your bonus.

This program is **active through December 31, 2025**, and targets investors transferring significant assets from traditional banks.

## The Complete Bonus Tiers

Here's the full breakdown of how much you can earn:

| Your Net Funding Amount | Base Bonus | Additional Bonus | Total Bonus |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| $1 â€“ $999             | $25        | $0               | **$25**     |
| $1,000 â€“ $9,999       | $25        | $25              | **$50**     |
| $10,000 â€“ $49,999     | $25        | $75              | **$100**    |
| $50,000 â€“ $99,999     | $25        | $175             | **$200**    |
| $100,000 â€“ $499,999   | $25        | $475             | **$500**    |
| $500,000 â€“ $999,999   | $25        | $1,475           | **$1,500**  |
| $1,000,000+             | $25        | $4,975           | **$5,000**  |

### What Is "Net Funding"?

Net funding is your total deposits minus any withdrawals during the funding period. This prevents gaming the system by depositing and immediately withdrawing.

**Example:** If you deposit $100,000 and withdraw $10,000 within the funding period, your net funding is $90,000, qualifying you for the $200 tier, not the $500 tier.

## How the Ladder Works

### Step 1: Sign Up with a Referral Code

You must use a valid referral code or link when creating your account.

ðŸ‘‰ **[Sign up with referral code 9C6DMQ](https://wealthsimple.com/invite/9C6DMQ)**

### Step 2: Fund Within 30 Days (or 90 Days for Transfers)

Wealthsimple gives you different windows depending on how you fund:

| Funding Method                            | Time Window |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Direct bank transfer (EFT)                | 30 days     |
| Institutional transfer (TFSA, RRSP, etc.) | 90 days     |

The extended 90-day window for institutional transfers acknowledges that bank-to-bank transfers can take 2-4 weeks due to paperwork.

**Important:** A direct institutional transfer (using form T2033 for registered accounts) moves funds between plans without touching your contribution room. This is different from withdrawing and redepositing, which would consume TFSA/RRSP room. Always let Wealthsimple initiate the transferâ€”don't withdraw the money yourself.

### Step 3: Reach Your Target Tier

You have the full funding period to accumulate deposits. Multiple deposits count toward your total.

**Example:** You deposit $50,000 immediately, then transfer your RRSP worth $60,000 that arrives 3 weeks later. Your total is $110,000, qualifying you for the $500 bonus.

### Step 4: Receive Your Bonus

Bonuses are typically paid within 24 hours of reaching your tier, though you'll receive the additional ladder bonus after the funding window closes and your net funding is confirmed.

## The Math: Is the Ladder Worth It?

Let's compare Wealthsimple's referral ladder to typical bank transfer offers:

### Scenario: Transferring $200,000

| Platform         | Bonus    | Requirements                                  |
| ---------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Wealthsimple** | **$500** | Use referral code, transfer within 90 days    |
| TD Bank          | $200-300 | Often requires new accounts + credit products |
| RBC              | $100-200 | Typically requires advisor meeting            |
| Big Bank Average | ~$200    | Complex requirements, limited availability    |

**Winner: Wealthsimple** â€“ 2-3x higher bonus with simpler requirements.

### Scenario: Transferring $1,000,000

| Platform         | Bonus      | Notes                               |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Wealthsimple** | **$5,000** | Cash bonus, no strings attached     |
| Private Banks    | Varies     | Often negotiate fee waivers instead |
| Robo-advisors    | $0-500     | Most don't have programs this large |

At the $1M+ level, Wealthsimple's $5,000 sign up bonus is effectively a **0.5% signing bonus**â€”comparable to negotiated fee reductions at private wealth managers.

> **Looking for device promotions instead?** If you're transferring $100K+, Wealthsimple sometimes offers iPhone or MacBook promotions as an alternative to the cash bonus. ðŸ‘‰ [Compare device promotions at $100K+ vs cash bonuses](/blog/promo-code-vs-referral-code)

## Combining with Transfer Fee Reimbursement

Here's where the math gets even better: Wealthsimple also reimburses transfer-out fees charged by your old bank.

### Current Policy (As of April 2025)

- **Minimum transfer:** $25,000 (increased from $15,000 in April 2025)
- **Reimbursement:** One transfer-out fee per institution (typically $135-$150)
- **Timeline:** Reimbursement appears within 2 business days
- **Hold period:** Account must stay funded for 90 days

> **Heads up:** If you have older bookmarks or saw Reddit posts mentioning a $15,000 minimum, that policy changed in April 2025. The new minimum is $25,000.

### Combined Savings Example

Transferring $100,000 from TD Bank:

| Benefit                    | Amount   |
| -------------------------- | -------- |
| Referral ladder bonus      | $500     |
| Transfer fee reimbursement | $150     |
| **Total immediate value**  | **$650** |

Plus, if you're moving to Premium status ($100K+ in assets), you also unlock:

- Lower management fees (0.4% vs 0.5%)
- Free USD account ($120/year value)
- Higher interest rates (1.75% vs 1.25%)

## Who Should Use the Referral Ladder?

The ladder is ideal for:

### âœ… RRSP/TFSA Consolidators

If you have retirement accounts scattered across multiple institutions, consolidating everything at Wealthsimple can trigger a significant bonus while simplifying your financial life.

### âœ… Bank Leavers

Frustrated with your Big Five bank's high fees and poor service? The combination of referral bonus + transfer fee reimbursement makes switching basically free.

### âœ… Inheritance Recipients

Received a significant inheritance? Starting fresh at Wealthsimple with a referral code maximizes your initial value.

### âœ… Downsizers

Selling a home and looking to invest proceeds? $500,000+ in proceeds from a home sale gets you a $1,500 bonus.

## Common Questions About the Ladder

### Does the Bonus Tier Apply to the Referrer Too?

Yes! The person who referred you also receives the corresponding bonus amount. This is why the ladder is sometimes called a "challenge"â€”it incentivizes referrers to target high-value individuals.

### Can I Split My Deposits to Get Multiple Bonuses?

No. Only one referral bonus relationship exists per client. Your total net funding determines your single tier.

### What If My Transfer Takes Longer Than 90 Days?

Delays caused by the sending institution (documented) may be accommodated. Contact Wealthsimple support with evidence of when you initiated the transfer.

### Are Referral Bonuses Taxable?

Wealthsimple doesn't issue tax slips for referral bonuses, but the income may still be reportable. Consult a tax professional, especially for larger amounts.

## Ready to Maximize Your Transfer Bonus?

If you're planning to move a significant portfolio to Wealthsimple, here's your action plan:

1. **[Sign up with referral code 9C6DMQ](https://wealthsimple.com/invite/9C6DMQ)**
2. Verify your identity (takes minutes)
3. Initiate your institutional transfer
4. Watch your bonus grow as funds arrive

The Referral Ladder Challenge is one of the best-kept secrets in Canadian fintech. Don't leave money on the table.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the minimum to get more than $25?

$1,000. Once you deposit $1,000+, you qualify for the $50 tier, representing a 100% increase over the base bonus.

### Can I transfer my pension to get the bonus?

If you have a locked-in account (LIRA) or defined contribution pension, you can transfer it and it will count 100% toward your Referral Ladder tier. Group RRSPs from former employers are also eligible.These transfers often take 3-4 weeks to process, so ensure you initiate them well before the deadline.

### How long do I need to keep the money at Wealthsimple?

The referral bonus has a 180-day hold. The transfer fee reimbursement requires a 90-day hold. Plan to keep funds invested for at least 6 months.

### What's the best Wealthsimple sign up bonus?

The best sign up bonus depends on your deposit amount. For most people, the referral code giving $25 for just $1 is ideal. For high-net-worth transfers ($100K+), either the tiered cash bonus (up to $5,000) or a device promotion may be more valuable.

### Can I refer my spouse to the Referral Ladder if we live at the same address?

Yes. Wealthsimple does not restrict referral bonuses based on household address. If your spouse is a new client (meaning they have never held a Wealthsimple investment or chequing account), you can refer them.

### Will I receive a T4A tax slip for the referral bonus?

No. Wealthsimple states in their terms that they do not issue T4A slips for referral bonuses paid into non-registered accounts. However, because the bonus is a cash incentive, it is technically considered taxable income by the CRA, and you are responsible for reporting it.

### Can I earn the Referral Ladder bonus on a Corporate Account?

Yes, Corporate accounts are eligible. If you are opening a new Corporate Investing account, it counts as a "new client" relationship. However, Wealthsimple usually deposits the cash bonus into a personal non-registered account (like a Cash account) linked to your profile to simplify the tax reporting for your corporation.

### What happens if my deposit drops in value due to the market?

You will not lose your bonus. Wealthsimple calculates your tier based on Net Funding (total deposits minus total withdrawals). If you deposit $100,000 and the market value drops to $90,000, your "Net Funding" is still $100,000. You only risk a clawback if you actively withdraw funds that drop your net funding below the tier threshold.

The Wealthsimple Cash account (now called "Chequing") has evolved into one of Canada's most competitive everyday banking products. This review covers everything you need to know about interest rates, the prepaid card, and whether it can replace your traditional bank.

## Current Interest Rates (December 2025)

Interest rates on the Wealthsimple Cash account vary based on your client tier and direct deposit status. Keep in mind that the Wealthsimple cash account interest rate fluctuates with the marketâ€”specifically, it moves with Bank of Canada rate decisions. As of December 2025 (following the November rate cut), here are the current rates:

| Tier                    | Base Rate | With Direct Deposit\* | Maximum Rate |
| ----------------------- | --------- | --------------------- | ------------ |
| **Core** (under $100K)  | 1.25%     | +0.50%                | **1.75%**    |
| **Premium** ($100K+)    | 1.75%     | +0.50%                | **2.25%**    |
| **Generation** ($500K+) | 2.25%     | â€”                   | **2.25%**    |

\*Direct deposit boost requires $2,000+ monthly deposit from payroll or government payments.

### How This Compares to Big Banks

| Institution      | High-Interest Savings Rate |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| TD               | 0.01% - 0.10%              |
| RBC              | 0.01% - 0.10%              |
| BMO              | 0.01% - 0.10%              |
| Scotiabank       | 0.01% - 0.10%              |
| **Wealthsimple** | **1.25% - 2.25%**          |

Wealthsimple offers **10-100x higher interest** than traditional banks on everyday cash.

### Interest Calculation

- Interest is calculated **daily** on your balance
- Paid out **monthly** to your account
- No minimum balance required to earn interest
- No promotional rate that expires

## The Wealthsimple Card

The physical card you receive with your Cash account is a **prepaid Mastercard**â€”not a traditional debit card.

### Key Features

**No Foreign Transaction Fees:**
This is the standout feature. Most Canadian credit and debit cards charge **2.5%** on foreign currency purchases. Wealthsimple charges **0%**.

For a $5,000 vacation:

- Traditional bank: $125 in FX fees
- Wealthsimple: **$0**

**1% Cash Back:**
Earn 1% rewards on purchases made with the card.

**Mobile Wallet Support:**
Works with Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Samsung Pay.

**Free ATM Withdrawals:**
Access ATMs in the Exchange and Cirrus networks without fees. Third-party ATM fees are reimbursed.

### Limitations

**Not Interac Debit:**
The Wealthsimple card is a prepaid Mastercard, not an Interac debit card. This means:

- âŒ Won't work at merchants that ONLY accept Interac (rare, but some government offices and small businesses)
- âŒ Can't use Interac e-Transfer from the card (use the app instead)
- âœ… Works everywhere Mastercard is accepted (99% of merchants)

**Loading Limits:**
As a prepaid card, there may be limits on how much you can spend in a single transaction. These are generally high enough for everyday use.

## USD Account Features

For users who hold US dollars (for US stock dividends, USD income, etc.), Wealthsimple offers a USD account:

| Feature       | Core      | Premium/Generation |
| ------------- | --------- | ------------------ |
| USD Account   | $10/month | Free               |
| USD Interest  | Limited   | Yes                |
| FX Conversion | 1.5% fee  | 1.5% fee           |

The USD account is particularly useful for:

- Collecting dividends from US stocks in USD
- Avoiding repeated currency conversions
- Traveling to the US frequently

## CDIC Insurance: Up to $1 Million

One of Wealthsimple's strongest features is its deposit insurance structure.

### How It Works

Wealthsimple partners with multiple federally regulated banks to hold your deposits. Each partner bank provides up to $100,000 in CDIC coverage per account type.

By spreading deposits across multiple partner banks, Wealthsimple provides **up to $1,000,000 in CDIC coverage**â€”10x the standard protection at a single bank.

### What's Protected

| Account Type  | Coverage                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------- |
| Chequing cash | Up to $1M                 |
| Crypto        | Not covered               |
| Investments   | CIPF up to $1M (separate) |

This makes the Cash account one of the safest places to park large amounts of cash in Canada.

## Private Credit Fund (Generation Tier)

For Generation clients ($500K+), Wealthsimple offers access to private credit investments.

### What Is Private Credit?

Private credit funds lend directly to businesses, bypassing traditional banks. They typically offer:

- Higher yields than traditional fixed income
- Lower correlation to stock markets
- Regular income distributions

### Risk Considerations

Private credit is **not risk-free**:

- Less liquid than stocks or ETFs
- Default risk on underlying loans
- Not suitable for emergency funds

This product is designed for sophisticated investors who understand the risks and want diversification beyond public markets.

## Opening a Wealthsimple Cash Account

Getting started is simple:

1. **[Sign up with referral code 9C6DMQ](https://wealthsimple.com/invite/9C6DMQ)** â€” Get a $25 bonus
2. Complete identity verification (takes minutes)
3. Your Cash/Chequing account is automatically opened
4. Order your free prepaid Mastercard
5. Link your bank account and transfer funds

There's no minimum deposit to open the account or start earning interest.

## Who Should Use Wealthsimple Cash?

### Perfect For:

âœ… **Emergency funds** â€” High interest + CDIC protection
âœ… **Travel** â€” No foreign transaction fees
âœ… **Everyday banking** â€” Modern app, instant transfers
âœ… **Wealthsimple investors** â€” Seamless integration with trading accounts

### Maybe Not For:

âŒ **People who need Interac-only payments** â€” Prepaid Mastercard has limitations
âŒ **Complex banking needs** â€” No mortgages, lines of credit, etc.

## Wealthsimple Cash vs. EQ Bank

EQ Bank is another popular high-interest alternative. Here's how they compare:

| Feature                | Wealthsimple Cash | EQ Bank          |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| Interest Rate          | 1.25%-2.25%       | 1.00%-2.75%      |
| Physical Card          | Yes (prepaid)     | Yes (Mastercard) |
| FX Fees                | 0%                | 1.5%             |
| CDIC Coverage          | Up to $1M         | $100K            |
| Investment Integration | Full              | Limited          |

**EQ Bank wins on:** Slightly higher max rate with direct deposit (2.75% vs 2.25%)

**Wealthsimple wins on:** No FX fees, higher CDIC coverage, investing integration

With recent Bank of Canada rate cuts, both platforms now offer similar interest rates. The choice comes down to whether you value travel-friendly banking (Wealthsimple) or slightly higher savings interest (EQ Bank).

## The $25 Bonus

When you open a Wealthsimple Cash account using a referral code and deposit $1+, you receive a **$25 cash bonus**.

This bonus is deposited directly into your Cash account and is yours to keep (subject to the 180-day hold period).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the Wealthsimple Cash interest rate in 2025?

Base rate is 1.25% for Core clients, increasing to 1.75% for Premium and 2.25% for Generation. A 0.5% boost is available with $2,000+/month direct deposit.

### Are there foreign transaction fees?

No. Wealthsimple charges 0% on foreign purchases, making it one of Canada's best travel cards.

### What's the best Wealthsimple sign up bonus?

The best sign up bonus is the referral code **9C6DMQ**â€”you get $25 cash for just a $1 deposit, plus it goes directly into your Cash account and starts earning interest immediately.

### Can I use the Wealthsimple card at Costco?

Yes! Costco Canada accepts Mastercard, so the Wealthsimple prepaid Mastercard works perfectly there. This is a common question since Costco previously only accepted Amex.

### Can I open a Joint Wealthsimple Cash account with my partner?

Yes. Wealthsimple now supports Joint Chequing accounts. You can invite a partner to join your account directly through the app. Both owners will have full access to the funds and can each order their own physical Wealthsimple Cash card.

### Does Wealthsimple reimburse ATM fees charged by other banks?

Yes. Wealthsimple does not charge ATM fees, and they also reimburse the fee charged by the ATM operator (e.g., the $3.00 fee from a CIBC ATM) for eligible withdrawals worldwide. This reimbursement typically appears in your account shortly after the transaction settles.

### How long do mobile cheque deposits take to clear?

It depends on your instant deposit limit. If your limit is $3,000 and you deposit a $1,000 cheque, the funds are usually available immediately. If you deposit a $10,000 cheque, the first $3,000 is available instantly, and the remaining $7,000 will be held for approximately 5â€“7 business days to clear.

### Does the Wealthsimple Cash account have overdraft protection?

No. The Wealthsimple Cash account does not offer traditional overdraft protection or credit. If a transaction (like a pre-authorized payment) pushes your balance below zero, you must add funds immediately to resolve the negative balance, or your account may be suspended.

### Will I actually get paid a day early with direct deposit?

In most cases, yes. Traditional banks hold payroll funds until the official "payday" (usually Friday). Wealthsimple releases the funds as soon as they receive the notice from the payment clearing system, which often happens on the afternoon or evening of the previous day (e.g., Thursday).

The Canadian crypto scene has changed. A lot.

Remember when we had to wire money to sketchy offshore exchanges and hope it actually arrived? Those days are gone. In 2025, itâ€™s really a three-horse race: **Wealthsimple Crypto**, **Newton**, and **Shakepay**.

So, which one is actually the best?

Hereâ€™s the honest truth: **There isn't one.**

Iâ€™ve used all three. Each one is great at something specific, and terrible at something else. One is my go-to for regular buys. Another is where I hoard my long-term holds. And one is just for the altcoins I can't find anywhere else.

Here is the complete, no-fluff breakdown of Wealthsimple Crypto vs Newton vs Shakepay to help you figure out which one fits _you_.

## Quick Comparison Overview

| Feature             | Wealthsimple Crypto      | Newton                    | Shakepay                         |

## Fee Structure Analysis

Crypto fees are a headache. And companies love to hide them. Some charge a commission. Others hide their cut in the "spread" (the gap between the buy and sell price).

### Wealthsimple Crypto

Wealthsimple is transparent. They charge an operation fee on every trade. The percentage just depends on how much cash you have with them:

- **Core (Under $100k):** 2% fee
- **Premium ($100k+):** 1% fee
- **Generation ($500k+):** 0.5% fee

**Pros:** You know exactly what you're paying. If you're a Generation client, 0.5% is incredibly cheap for a platform this regulated.
**Cons:** If you're starting small (Core tier), that 2% fee hurts. A lot.

### Newton

Newton claims "no fees". But that's marketing speak. They make money on the spread.

- **Spread:** Usually **0.50% to 0.70%** for BTC/ETH, but can be 3-6% for less liquid altcoins
- **Surge Pricing:** Heads upâ€”when the market goes crazy, these spreads can widen.

**Pros:** For the average person just trading altcoins, this is often the cheapest option.
**Cons:** The "no fee" tag is misleading. You are paying a fee; you just don't see it on a separate line.

### Shakepay

Shakepay is the easiest app to use. Period. But you pay for that convenience.

- **Spread:** Typically **1.5% to 2%**

**Pros:** They **cover withdrawal gas fees**. This is huge. Iâ€™ve saved hundreds of dollars in ETH gas fees just by using Shakepay.
**Cons:** Don't day trade here. The fees will eat you alive.

## Staking & Rewards

If you're holding for the long run, you might as well get paid for it.

### Wealthsimple Crypto: The Staking King

Wealthsimple lets you stake Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and Polkadot.

- **Yield:** Varies (currently ~3-5% for ETH).
- **Convenience:** Itâ€™s one click. Seriously.
- **Cost:** They take a cut (30% for Core, 15% for Generation), but frankly, avoiding the technical headache of on-chain staking is worth it for most people.

### Shakepay: The "ShakingSats" Phenomenon

Shakepay doesn't do staking. But they have **ShakingSats**.

- **How it works:** Open the app. Shake your phone. Get free Bitcoin.
- **The catch:** You need a referral code to unlock it.
- **My take:** It sounds silly, but I do it every morning. Itâ€™s small amounts, sure. But over a year? It adds up to a nice little stack of sats for literally zero effort.

### Newton

Newton is purely for trading. No staking. No shaking. Just buying and selling.

## Crypto Withdrawals: A Key Difference

This is the big one. Do you leave coins on the exchange, or move them to a cold wallet like a Ledger?

- **Shakepay (Winner):** They pay the miner fees. If you buy $50 of Bitcoin and send it to your wallet, you get the full value. This makes Shakepay the ultimate "on-ramp."
- **Newton:** You pay the network fees. For ETH, this can get pricey.
- **Wealthsimple:** You pay the standard network fees.

## The Verdict: Which Platform is For You?

Like I said, there isn't one winner. It depends on _you_.

### Choose Wealthsimple Crypto if:

You want it all in one place. If you already check Wealthsimple for your RRSP and stocks, seeing your crypto right next to it is just convenient. It's also the clear winner for **high-net-worth investors** who get those low fees, or anyone who wants **staking rewards** without the stress.

ðŸ‘‰ **[Sign up for Wealthsimple](https://wealthsimple.com/invite/9C6DMQ)** (Code: 9C6DMQ for $25 bonus)

### Choose Newton if:

Youâ€™re hunting for altcoins. Maybe you want SOL or DOT but don't have $100k for Wealthsimple Premium. With 70+ coins and tight spreads, Newton is the sweet spot for the average Canadian trader who wants variety without getting gouged.

ðŸ‘‰ **[Sign up for Newton](https://web.newton.co/r/JPPX31)** (Code: JPPX31 for $25 bonus after trading $100)

### Choose Shakepay if:

Youâ€™re a Bitcoin or Ethereum purist. And you love self-custody. The free withdrawals make it the perfect place to buy your BTC and immediately move it to your hardware wallet. Use the referral code, unlock ShakingSats, and get your free daily stats. Itâ€™s a no-brainer.

ðŸ‘‰ **[Sign up for Shakepay](https://shakepay.me/r/059XIVK)** (Code: 059XIVK for $20 bonus after trading $100 worth of BTC or ETH)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Which platform is safer?

They're all solid. Wealthsimple Crypto is a CIRO-registered dealerâ€”thatâ€™s the gold standard for regulation here. Newton and Shakepay are registered with FINTRAC. Wealthsimple uses Gemini for custody with $200M insurance, which gives me a lot of peace of mind.

### How long does it take to unstake my crypto on Wealthsimple?

For Ethereum, there is a warm-up and unbonding period that can take several days to weeks depending on network congestion (usually a queue + ~27 hours). You won't be able to sell these assets until that period is over. So its not instant.

### Why can't I buy USDT (Tether) on Wealthsimple?

Tether (USDT) is the world's most popular stablecoin, but it is effectively banned on regulated Canadian platforms. Wealthsimple is a fully compliant restricted dealer under the OSC, meaning they only list approved assets like USDC.

### How do I get my crypto tax documents from Wealthsimple?

Preparing for taxes? If you're looking for **wealthsimple crypto tax documents for Koinly**, it's actually quite simple. Unlike some platforms that require complex API keys, Wealthsimple provides a dedicated "Crypto Realized Gain Loss Report" (CSV) in the app's documents section. You can simply download this file and upload it directly to Koinly.

### Is there a limit on how much crypto I can withdraw to my wallet on Wealthsimple?

Yes, there is a limit. For security, the **wealthsimple crypto withdrawal limit daily** is typically set around $10,000 CAD equivalent (or $25,000 weekly). This is important for "whales" or anyone moving large sums to self-custody. Competing platforms like Newton or Shakepay may have different limits, so check this if you plan to move high volumes frequently.

## How the Wealthsimple Referral Program Works

Honestly, Wealthsimple's referral program is one of the better ones you'll find in Canadian fintech. It's straightforward. The payout is genuinely quick. And the process? Dead simple. Here's how the whole thing works:

### Step 1: Sign Up Using a Referral Link

When you click a referral link (like the one above), you're automatically connected to the referrer. No need to manually enter anything.

### Step 2: Fund Your Account with $1+

You only need to deposit **$1 or more** within 30 days of opening your account. This can go into any eligible account:

- Self-directed Trading
- Managed Investing (Robo-advisor)
- Crypto
- Chequing account

### Step 3: Receive Your $25 Bonus

Here's the nice partâ€”your cash bonus typically shows up in your Wealthsimple Chequing account within 24 hours. Most people get it the same day. Some within a few hours. Seriously.

## The Referral Ladder: Earn Up to $5,000

Here's something a lot of people missâ€”Wealthsimple doesn't just give you $25 and call it a day. They've got this **tiered bonus structure** called the "Referral Ladder Challenge" that runs through December 31, 2025. The more you deposit, the bigger your bonus gets.

Here's the full breakdown:

| Your Deposit Amount   | Your Bonus |
| --------------------- | ---------- |
| $1 â€“ $999           | $25        |
| $1,000 â€“ $9,999     | $50        |
| $10,000 â€“ $49,999   | $100       |
| $50,000 â€“ $99,999   | $200       |
| $100,000 â€“ $499,999 | $500       |
| $500,000 â€“ $999,999 | $1,500     |
| $1,000,000+           | $5,000     |

If you're moving a decent-sized portfolio from one of the big banks, this ladder can mean **thousands of dollars in free cash**. Not a bad deal for paperwork you'd be doing anyway, right?

## Transferring From a Big Bank? What You Need to Know

Many Canadians claiming the referral bonus are moving their investments from TD, RBC, BMO, Scotiabank, or CIBC. Here's what to expect:

### Transfer Fee Reimbursement

Most banks charge $135-$150 + tax to transfer out. Wealthsimple reimburses this fee if:

- You transfer **$25,000 or more**
- The transfer completes successfully
- You keep funds in Wealthsimple for 90 days

| Your Situation | Referral Bonus | Transfer Fee Reimbursement | Total Value |
| -------------- | -------------- | -------------------------- | ----------- |
| $25K transfer  | $100           | ~$150                      | **~$250**   |
| $50K transfer  | $200           | ~$150                      | **~$350**   |
| $100K transfer | $500           | ~$150                      | **~$650**   |

### Bank-Specific Tips

**TD Bank:** Keep $160+ cash in your TD account to cover the transfer fee. TD won't process the transfer if you don't have enough cash to pay their fee.

**BMO with Mutual Funds:** BMO's proprietary mutual funds can't transfer "in-kind" to Wealthsimple. They'll need to be sold first, which could create a tax event in non-registered accounts.

**RBC/Scotiabank/CIBC:** Generally straightforward. Expect 2-4 weeks for the full transfer process.

### The 90-Day Extended Window

For institutional transfers (RRSP, TFSA, LIRA, etc.), Wealthsimple gives you a **90-day window** instead of 30 days to complete the transfer and qualify for the referral ladder. This acknowledges the reality that bank transfers can be slow.

## Wealthsimple Referral Code for Existing Clients

One of the most common questions we get is: **"I already signed up but forgot to use a referral code. Is it too late?"** If you're an existing client looking for a Wealthsimple referral code, here's the breakdown:

### If You Haven't Funded Your Account Yet

Good news! You can still add a referral code at any time before making your first deposit. Here's how:

1. Open the Wealthsimple app
2. Tap the **Gift icon** at the top of the screen
3. Go to the **"Referrals"** tab
4. Select **"I was referred by someone"**
5. Enter the code: **9C6DMQ**

### If You've Already Funded Your Account

You have a **7-day window** after your first deposit to add a referral code retroactively. After 7 days, the option disappears from the app entirely.

To add the code during this window:

1. Open the Wealthsimple app
2. Navigate to **Settings > Earn Rewards > Add a referral code**
3. Enter: **9C6DMQ**

âš ï¸ **Important:** After 7 days, the system will reject any referral code attempts. This is a strict policy, and even customer support typically cannot override it.

## What Reddit Users Say About Wealthsimple Referral Codes

Searching for a Wealthsimple referral code on Reddit? You'll find plenty of real user experiences from 2025. Here are the key takeaways from the community:

### âœ… The Good

- **"Got my $25 within hours"** - Most users confirm fast payouts
- **"The referral ladder is legit"** - Users transferring large portfolios confirm receiving higher bonuses
- **"Way better than bank sign-up offers"** - Compared to traditional bank promotions, Wealthsimple's program is more accessible

### âš ï¸ Things to Watch For

- **"I missed the 7-day window"** - Many regret not entering their code sooner
- **"Bonus goes to Chequing, not TFSA"** - By design, bonuses land in your Chequing account to avoid affecting contribution room
- **"Make sure you have a Chequing account open"** - You need one to receive the bonus

The Reddit consensus? Pretty simple: **use a referral code when you sign up** and don't sit on your hands before funding. The people who regret it are almost always the ones who waited too long.

## Referral Bonus Terms and Conditions

Alright, let's talk fine print. Nobody loves this part. But it's worth knowing before you jump in:

### Eligibility Requirements

- Must be a **new Wealthsimple client** (never opened any account before)
- Must be a **Canadian resident** of legal age in your province
- Must fund your account with at least **$1 within 30 days**

## Why Canadians Are Switching to Wealthsimple

Understanding why others have made the switch can help you decide if it's right for you. Here's what makes Wealthsimple stand out for the average Canadian investor:

### The Fee Advantage

| What You're Doing        | Traditional Bank          | Wealthsimple                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Buy $5,000 of RBC stock  | $9.95+ commission         | $0                          |
| Hold USD from dividends  | Often poor exchange rates | Free USD account (Premium+) |
| Managed portfolio ($50K) | 1%+ fees                  | 0.4-0.5%                    |
| High-interest savings    | 0.01-0.10%                | 1.25-2.25%                  |

For a typical investor making 2-3 trades per month with $50K invested, switching to Wealthsimple can save $300-500 annuallyâ€”not including the referral bonus.

### Mobile-First Experience

Wealthsimple consistently ranks as the top-rated financial app in Canada. The interface is designed for everyday investors, not traders who need Bloomberg terminals. Features include:

- Clean portfolio overview
- One-tap stock purchases
- Instant deposits from linked banks
- Real-time notifications for price movements

### The All-in-One Ecosystem

What really sets Wealthsimple apart is the integration. Your investments, banking, crypto, and taxes all live in one place:

- **Transfer between accounts instantly** (no waiting for wire transfers)
- **See your complete financial picture** in one dashboard
- **Tax time is simplified** with automatic imports to Wealthsimple Tax

This integration is why starting with the referral bonus makes senseâ€”even if you only use one feature now, you'll have access to everything as your needs grow.

### The Wealthsimple vs Questrade Question

If you're comparing platforms, here's the quick version:

| Feature                 | Wealthsimple                | Questrade                  |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Commission**          | $0                          | $0 (as of 2025)            |
| **Currency conversion** | 1.5% (or free with Premium) | 1.5% (or Norbert's Gambit) |
| **Mobile app**          | â­â­â­â­â­                  | â­â­â­                     |
| **Sign up bonus**       | $25+ referral code          | Varies                     |
| **Banking integration** | Full Cash account           | None                       |

For most Canadians, especially those under $100K in assets, Wealthsimple offers the better overall experience. At higher asset levels, Questrade's Norbert's Gambit gives it an edge for USD tradingâ€”but Wealthsimple is adding this feature in 2026.

## Wealthsimple Promo Code vs Referral Code: Which Is Better?

If you've been searching for a "Wealthsimple promo code" or "Wealthsimple sign up bonus," you've probably noticed two types of codes floating around. Here's the honest breakdown:

|                         | Wealthsimple Promo Code         | Referral Code       |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Source**              | Seasonal campaigns              | Existing users      |
| **Reward Type**         | Often devices (iPhone, AirPods) | Cash ($25+)         |
| **Funding Requirement** | Usually $100K+                  | Just $1             |
| **Availability**        | Limited time                    | Always available    |
| **Stacking**            | Usually not stackable           | Works independently |

### Why Most Canadians Should Use a Referral Code

From what we've seen here in Canada, the **standard referral code is the better choice** for everyday investors because:

- The $1 minimum is achievable by anyone looking for a Wealthsimple sign up bonus
- Cash is more flexible than the devices offered in promo campaigns
- It's always availableâ€”no rushing to meet promotional deadlines

### When a Wealthsimple Promo Code Makes Sense

That said, if you're transferring $100,000+ and Wealthsimple is running one of their device promotions (like the iPhone or MacBook deals), the promo code might actually beat the referral bonus in terms of total value. We break down exactly when each option wins in our detailed comparison.

## How Much Can You Really Earn? Real Examples

Let's run through some realistic scenarios as a Canadian investor:

### Scenario 1: Just Getting Started ($1 deposit)

- **Your Wealthsimple sign up bonus:** $25 cash
- **Time investment:** 5 minutes to sign up
- **Return:** Essentially infinite (free money for $1)

### Scenario 2: Moving Your TFSA ($50,000 transfer)

- **Your referral bonus:** $200 cash
- **Transfer fee reimbursement:** ~$150 (if your bank charges)
- **Total immediate value:** $350
- **Promo alternative:** Not eligible for most device promos at this level

### Scenario 3: Consolidating Retirement Accounts ($500,000 transfer)

- **Your referral bonus:** $1,500 cash
- **Transfer fee reimbursement:** ~$150
- **Total immediate value:** $1,650
- **Promo alternative:** Could get an iPhone (~$1,500 value) but you'd miss the cash bonus

Based on user reports, most people prefer the cashâ€”but if you were already planning to buy that iPhone, the Wealthsimple promo might be worth considering.

Look, there are referral codes all over Reddit and random forums. Here's why ours is worth using:

- âœ… **Kept up to date** â€” if something changes, we'll know about it
- âœ… **Complete guides** â€” not just a code dump, but actual helpful info
- âœ… **No spam** â€” just this resource, that's it

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will I receive my Wealthsimple sign up bonus?

Your $25 cash bonus is typically deposited within 24 hours of making a qualifying deposit of $1 or more. From what we've seen, most users get it the same day.

### Can I use a referral code if I already have a Wealthsimple account?

Only if you've never funded any account before. If you've already made a deposit, you have exactly 7 days to add a referral code retroactively.

### Iâ€™ve used Wealthsimple Tax before. Am I eligible for the sign up bonus?

Yes, in most cases. Wealthsimple's terms define a "New Client" as someone who has not previously opened a Wealthsimple Investing, Crypto, or Chequing account. If you have only ever used Wealthsimple Tax (formerly SimpleTax) to file your return, you are likely still eligible for the $25 bonus when you open and fund your first asset account.

### Can I use a referral code to open a Corporate Account?

Yes, Corporate Accounts are eligible for referral bonuses. However, because Wealthsimple Corporate accounts do not always have "Chequing" features enabled, the referral bonus is typically deposited into the personal non-registered account of the authorized trader associated with the corporation.

### Can I refer my spouse if we live at the same address?

Yes. You can refer friends, family, and spouses even if they live in the same household. As long as the person you are referring is a new client (has never funded a Wealthsimple account), you will both receive the cash bonus.

### Where does my referral bonus go?

Bonuses are deposited into your Wealthsimple Chequing account, not your investment accounts. This prevents any impact on your TFSA or RRSP contribution room.

### Can I stack a Wealthsimple promo code with a referral code?

Generally, no. You have to choose one or the other when signing up. The same funds can't trigger both bonuses.

### Can I refer my friends after signing up?

Yes! Once you're a Wealthsimple client, you get your own referral link and can earn $25 for each friend who signs up and deposits $1+. There's no limit to how many people you can refer.

Tax season is stressful. But it doesn't have to be expensive. **Wealthsimple Tax** (formerly SimpleTax) is a free, CRA-certified tax preparation software that handles everything from simple T4s to complex investment income. Here's our complete 2025 review.

## What Is Wealthsimple Tax?

Wealthsimple Tax is a web-based tax preparation and filing service that:

- Is **completely free** (pay-what-you-want donation model)
- Is **CRA NETFILE certified** for electronic filing
- Handles both simple and complex returns
- Integrates directly with Wealthsimple investment accounts

### The "Pay What You Want" Model

Unlike TurboTax or H&R Block, Wealthsimple Tax has no mandatory fees. After completing your return, you're invited to donate what you think the service is worthâ€”including $0.

| Plan     | Cost                   | Features                        |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Free** | $0 (optional donation) | Full tax filing capabilities    |
| **Plus** | $29.99                 | Priority support, audit defense |
| **Pro**  | $89.99                 | Expert review, 1-on-1 advice    |

Most users never need more than the free tier. Seriously.

## Key Features

### Auto-Fill from CRA

Wealthsimple Tax can automatically import your tax slips directly from the CRA. This includes:

- T4 (Employment income)
- T5 (Investment income)
- T3 (Trust income)
- RRSP contribution receipts
- And more

Simply connect your CRA My Account, and most of your slips are imported instantly.

### Investment Integration

Here's where Wealthsimple Tax shines for investors:

**Direct Wealthsimple Import:**
If you have Wealthsimple trading accounts, your trading activity is automatically imported, including:

- Capital gains and losses
- Foreign income (dividends from US stocks)
- Cryptocurrency transactions
- Adjusted Cost Base (ACB) calculations

**The Crypto Advantage:**
Calculating crypto taxes manually is notoriously complex. Wealthsimple Tax auto-imports your Wealthsimple Crypto transactions and calculates ACB automaticallyâ€”a feature that could save you hours.

### Comprehensive Tax Situations

Wealthsimple Tax handles:

âœ… Employment income (T4)
âœ… Self-employment income
âœ… Rental property income
âœ… Investment income (dividends, capital gains)
âœ… Cryptocurrency gains and losses
âœ… RRSP deposits and withdrawals
âœ… Child and family benefits
âœ… Student loans and tuition credits
âœ… Moving expenses
âœ… Medical expenses
âœ… Charitable donations

### Refund Optimization

The software includes tools to maximize your refund:

**Pension Income Splitting:**
Automatically suggests the optimal split between spouses.

**Spousal Dividend Claims:**
Identifies when transferring dividends benefits your family tax position.

**Carryforward Amounts:**
Tracks unused tuition credits, capital losses, and donation amounts from previous years.

**RRSP Optimizer:**
Shows exactly how RRSP contributions will impact your refund.

### 100% Accuracy Guarantee

Wealthsimple Tax guarantees that if you owe penalties or interest due to a calculation error they made, they'll pay the difference.

## New for 2025

### Tax Video Walkthroughs

New video guides walk you through different sections of your tax return.

### Guided Tax-Filing

A new assistant helps build a template based on your specific situation.

### CRA Payments Integration

If you owe taxes, you can now add the CRA as a payee directly in your Wealthsimple Chequing account.

## Limitations

### No Dedicated Mobile App

The previous mobile app was discontinued. You can still access Wealthsimple Tax through your mobile browser, but it's optimized for desktop.

### Support Limitations

Free users only have email support. Live chat and phone support are reserved for Plus and Pro subscribers.

### 20 Return Limit

The free version allows up to 20 returns per accountâ€”plenty for most people, but a limit for those doing taxes for many family members.

### Quebec Complex Returns

While Quebec returns are supported, some very complex Quebec-specific situations may not be fully covered.

### No T3 Trust Returns

If you're an executor handling an estate, note that Wealthsimple Tax supports the final T1 return for a deceased individual, but does **not** support T3 Trust Income Tax returns for the estate itself. You'll need separate software or an accountant for that.

## Wealthsimple Tax vs. TurboTax

| Feature                    | Wealthsimple Tax         | TurboTax          |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------- |
| **Base Price**             | Free                     | $0-$200+          |
| **Investment Integration** | Automatic (Wealthsimple) | Manual import     |
| **Crypto Calculation**     | Automatic ACB            | Limited           |
| **Support**                | Email (free tier)        | Chat/phone (paid) |
| **Mobile App**             | Browser only             | Dedicated app     |
| **CRA Auto-fill**          | Yes                      | Yes               |

**Wealthsimple Tax wins on:** Price. Crypto handling. Investment integration.

**TurboTax wins on:** Mobile app experience, live support access

For Wealthsimple investors, Wealthsimple Tax is the obvious choice due to seamless integration.

## Options Trading and Taxes

For options traders, tax filing can be complex. Wealthsimple Tax imports your options trading activity and categorizes gains/losses appropriately.

**What's Tracked:**

- Premium received from writing options
- Gains/losses from buying and selling options
- Assignment and exercise transactions

**Reddit Feedback:**
Users on r/PersonalFinanceCanada and r/CanadianInvestor report that Wealthsimple Tax handles options better than most retail tax software, though complex multi-leg strategies may require manual review.

## The Investment Account Referral Opportunity

Tax season represents a unique opportunity to convert Wealthsimple Tax users into investors.

**The Funnel:**

1. Use Wealthsimple Tax (free)
2. Receive your tax refund
3. Invest the refund in Wealthsimple Trade
4. Claim a $25 referral bonus on top

If you're getting a refund anyway, depositing it into a TFSA with Wealthsimple and earning a bonus is one of the smartest moves you can make.

ðŸ‘‰ **[Sign up for Wealthsimple with code 9C6DMQ](https://wealthsimple.com/invite/9C6DMQ)** and get a $25 sign up bonus when you deposit your refund.

## How to Use Wealthsimple Tax

### Step 1: Create an Account

Go to [wealthsimple.com/tax](https://wealthsimple.com/tax) and sign up (or log in with your existing Wealthsimple account).

### Step 2: Import Your Data

Connect to CRA My Account to auto-import slips. If you have Wealthsimple investments, these import automatically.

### Step 3: Complete Your Return

The guided interface walks you through each section. Use the search bar to find specific slips or deductions.

### Step 4: Review and File

Review your calculated refund/balance. File electronically through NETFILE.

### Step 5: (Optional) Donate

If you found the service valuable, you're invited to donateâ€”but there's no obligation.

## Is Wealthsimple Tax Right for You?

### Perfect For:

âœ… **Wealthsimple investors** â€” Seamless integration
âœ… **Crypto traders** â€” Automatic ACB calculation
âœ… **Budget-conscious filers** â€” Truly free
âœ… **Self-employed individuals** â€” Handles business income
âœ… **Students** â€” Tracks tuition and education credits

### Maybe Not For:

âŒ **People who need phone support** â€” Only email for free tier
âŒ **Highly complex situations** â€” May need professional accountant
âŒ **Quebec residents with very complex returns** â€” Some limitations

## The Bottom Line

So here's the deal. Wealthsimple Tax is arguably the best free tax software in Canada.

For Wealthsimple investors in particular, the automatic import of trading activity, crypto calculations, and ACB tracking makes tax season significantly less painful.

And when you receive that refund? Consider investing it and claiming a **$25 referral bonus**.

ðŸ‘‰ **[Sign up with referral code 9C6DMQ](https://wealthsimple.com/invite/9C6DMQ)** and claim your Wealthsimple sign up bonus when you put your refund to work.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Wealthsimple Tax really free?

Yes. You can complete and file your entire return for $0. The donation at the end is completely optional.

### Can I file in Quebec?

Yes, Wealthsimple Tax supports both federal and Quebec provincial returns.

### Does it handle cryptocurrency?

Yes, and it's one of the best free options for crypto. If you trade crypto on Wealthsimple, your ACB and gains/losses are calculated automatically.

### Does Wealthsimple Tax handle the T1135 form for foreign assets?

Yes. If you hold foreign property with a total cost of over $100,000 CAD, Wealthsimple Tax fully supports Form T1135. It will guide you through using either the Simplified Reporting Method (Part A) or the Detailed Reporting Method (Part B) depending on your asset value.

### Can I file a final return for a deceased person?

Yes, Wealthsimple Tax supports the preparation and filing of a Final Return (T1) for a deceased individual. However, note that it does not currently support T3 Trust Income Tax returns, which may be required for the estate itself.

### Is the "Plus" plan with Audit Protection worth it?

The free version already includes a 100% accuracy guarantee on calculations. The "Audit Protection" in the Plus plan pays for a tax expert to defend you and correspond with the CRA if your return is reviewed. For simple T4 returns, it is likely unnecessary. For self-employed individuals or those with rental income, the $30 fee may be worth the peace of mind.

### Can I file taxes for previous years (catch-up filing)?

Yes. Wealthsimple Tax allows you to prepare and file returns going back to the 2016 tax year. You will need to select the specific tax year you wish to file from the dropdown menu in your dashboard.

### Where do I find my NETFILE Access Code?

Your NETFILE Access Code (NAC) is an 8-character code located on the top right corner of your previous year's Notice of Assessment from the CRA. Entering this code verifies your identity and allows you to use the "Auto-fill my return" feature to automatically import your T4s, T5s, and RRSP slips.

The **Wealthsimple vs Questrade** question comes up constantly among Canadian DIY investors. And honestly? Both platforms have gotten a lot better in 2025. The real answer depends on how you actually invest.

## Quick Comparison Overview

| Feature                   | Wealthsimple           | Questrade                  |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Canadian Stock Trades** | $0                     | $0                         |
| **US Stock Trades**       | $0 (+ FX fee)          | $0                         |
| **ETF Purchases**         | $0                     | $0                         |
| **ETF Sells**             | $0                     | $0                         |
| **Options**               | $0 + $0.75-$2/contract | $0 + $0.99/contract        |
| **Currency Conversion**   | 1.5% (or USD account)  | 1.5% (or Norbert's Gambit) |
| **Robo-Advisor**          | 0.4%-0.5%              | 0.25% (Questwealth)        |
| **Account Minimum**       | $0                     | $0                         |
| **Mobile App**            | â­â­â­â­â­             | â­â­â­                     |

## Trading Fees: Both Are Now Commission-Free

As of early 2025, both Wealthsimple and Questrade offer **$0 commission trading** for Canadian and US stocks and ETFs.

### The History

- **Wealthsimple Trade:** Launched commission-free from the start
- **Questrade:** Eliminated commissions in February 2025 to compete

This levels the playing field for basic stock and ETF purchases. So where do the real differences show up? Currency conversion. Options. And the little details.

## Currency Conversion: This Is the Big One

Here's where the two platforms really differâ€”and if you're buying US stocks regularly, pay attention:

### Wealthsimple's Approach

**Standard (Core tier):** 1.5% FX fee on every US dollar conversion

- Buy $10,000 of NVIDIA â†’ Pay $150 in FX
- Sell $10,000 of NVIDIA â†’ Pay another $150 in FX
- Round-trip cost: **$300 (3%)**

**With USD Account:**

- Core: $10/month subscription
- Premium ($100K+): Free
- Generation ($500K+): Free

The USD Account lets you convert once and hold USD, eliminating per-trade conversion fees.

### Questrade's Approach

**Standard:** 1.99% FX fee (slightly higher than Wealthsimple's 1.5%)

**But with key advantages:**

1. **USD in Registered Accounts:** Questrade lets you hold USD in your TFSA, RRSP, etc.â€”all users, no subscription
2. **Norbert's Gambit:** Convert CAD to USD for virtually $0 using an interlisted security

### What Is Norbert's Gambit?

Norbert's Gambit is a technique to convert currency at minimal cost:

1. Buy a stock listed on both TSX (CAD) and NYSE (USD) â€” e.g., Royal Bank (RY)
2. Journal the shares from the CAD side to the USD side
3. Sell the shares for USD
4. Total cost: ~0.05% vs 1.5% with direct conversion

**Questrade actively supports this.** You can journal shares between currencies for minimal or no fee.

**Wealthsimple** has teased Norbert's Gambit support for early 2026, but as of late 2025, it's not yet available.

### Currency Conversion Verdict

| Your Situation                         | Better Platform              |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Only trade CAD stocks                  | Tie                          |
| Trade occasional US stocks             | Wealthsimple + USD Account   |
| Trade frequent US stocks (under $100K) | Questrade                    |
| Trade frequent US stocks ($100K+)      | Tie (both free USD)          |
| Large USD conversions                  | Questrade (Norbert's Gambit) |

## Options Trading Fees

Options trading is where active traders see meaningful differences:

|                      | Wealthsimple              | Questrade        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Commission**       | $0                        | $0               |
| **Per-Contract Fee** | $0.75-$2 USD              | $0.99 USD        |
| **Tier Pricing**     | Core: $2, Premium+: $0.75 | All users: $0.99 |

**Questrade wins** for Core-tier Wealthsimple users ($2 vs $0.99).

**Wealthsimple wins** for Premium/Generation users ($0.75 vs $0.99).

Both platforms now support advanced strategies like spreads and iron condors.

## Robo-Advisor: Managed Portfolios

If you prefer hands-off investing:

| Feature                |        Wealthsimple Invest | Questwealth |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------: | ----------: |
| **Minimum Investment** |                         $1 |        $250 |
| **Management Fee**     |                  0.4%-0.5% |       0.25% |
| **Features**           | Tax-loss harvesting, Halal | Rebalancing |

**Questwealth is cheaper** (0.25% vs 0.4-0.5%).

**Wealthsimple has more features** (automatic tax-loss harvesting, Halal portfolios, SRI options).

For a $50,000 portfolio:

- Wealthsimple: $250/year
- Questwealth: $125/year

The $125 differenceâ€”worth it for the extra features? Maybe. It depends on whether you'll actually use tax-loss harvesting and the SRI/Halal options.

## Platform Experience

### Mobile App

**Wealthsimple:** Consistently rated among the best financial apps in Canada. Clean, intuitive, fast.

**Questrade:** Functional but dated. The app works but isn't as polished.

**Winner: Wealthsimple** (significantly better UX)

### Desktop Trading

**Wealthsimple:** Web-based only. Works well but limited charting and analysis tools.

**Questrade:** Has IQ Edge, a full desktop trading platform with advanced features for active traders.

**Winner: Questrade** (for power users)

### Research & Tools

**Wealthsimple:** Basic company info, no advanced charting.

**Questrade:** More detailed research, better charting options, IQ Edge platform.

**Winner: Questrade** (for active traders)

## Transfer Fee Reimbursement

Both platforms will reimburse transfer-out fees from your old institution:

|                          | Wealthsimple    | Questrade          |
| ------------------------ | --------------- | ------------------ |
| **Minimum Transfer**     | $25,000         | $25,000            |
| **Reimbursement Speed**  | 2 business days | 5-10 business days |
| **Documentation Needed** | Automatic       | Sometimes required |

Both are comparable, with Wealthsimple being slightly faster.

## Banking & Cash Features

### Wealthsimple Cash

Wealthsimple goes beyond investing with its Chequing account:

- 1.25%-2.25% interest on cash
- No foreign transaction fees on card
- CDIC insurance up to $1 million (across partner banks)

### Questrade

No equivalent banking product. Cash in trading accounts doesn't earn competitive interest.

**Winner: Wealthsimple** â€” if you want everything in one app, this is where Wealthsimple pulls ahead.

## Crypto Trading

|                          | Wealthsimple | Questrade |
| ------------------------ | ------------ | --------- |
| **Direct Crypto**        | Yes (2% fee) | No        |
| **Crypto ETFs**          | Yes          | Yes       |
| **Withdrawal to Wallet** | Yes          | N/A       |

If you want direct crypto exposure in the same app as your stocks, Wealthsimple offers it. Questrade only offers crypto through ETFs.

## What About Interactive Brokers?

Some advanced traders ask about Interactive Brokers (IBKR) as a third option. Here's the quick take:

| Factor             | Wealthsimple               | Questrade                      | Interactive Brokers          |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| **Target User**    | Beginners to intermediates | DIY investors                  | Professionals/Active traders |
| **Commission**     | $0                         | $0                             | $0.01/share (min $1)         |
| **USD Conversion** | 1.5% or USD Account        | Norbert's Gambit               | Best forex rates             |
| **Global Markets** | Canada, US only            | Canada, US, some international | 150+ markets worldwide       |
| **Interface**      | â­â­â­â­â­ Simple          | â­â­â­ Functional              | â­â­ Complex                 |
| **Margin Rates**   | Higher                     | Moderate                       | Lowest in industry           |

**IBKR wins on:** Global market access, margin rates, execution quality, and professional tools.

**Wealthsimple wins on:** Ease of use, Canadian integration, banking features, and accessibility for new investors.

**The verdict:** Interactive Brokers is overkill for most Canadians. If you need access to European or Asian markets, complex options strategies, or institutional-level margin rates, IBKR makes sense. For everyone else, Wealthsimple or Questrade covers 95% of needs with a far friendlier experience.

And here's one more thing. Wealthsimple has a robust referral program that gives you **$25+ cash** just for signing up with a referral code.

Questrade has referral offers, but they're less consistent and typically require higher deposits. However, if you do decide to go with Questrade, you can use the referral code **406714313487116** or this [direct link](https://questmobile.onelink.me/tX0y/419708l0) to claim the welcome bonus (typically $50 for a $250 deposit).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Wealthsimple or Questrade cheaper?

For CAD investing, they're essentially identical. For USD investing, Questrade is cheaper unless you have $100K+ at Wealthsimple (which gives you free USD accounts).

### Which has better customer support?

Wealthsimple has faster, more accessible support via in-app chat. Questrade has phone support but longer wait times.

### When is Norbert's Gambit coming to Wealthsimple?

Wealthsimple has announced that support for Norbert's Gambit (a method to convert CAD to USD cheaply) is scheduled for release in early 2026. Until then, you must pay the 1.5% FX fee or subscribe to the USD accounts to avoid conversion fees on every trade.

### Do I pay ECN fees on Questrade ETF purchases?

Yes. Although Questrade offers $0 commission on ETF buys, you may still be charged ECN fees (roughly $0.0035 per share) if your order "removes liquidity" from the market (e.g., a marketable limit order or market order). Wealthsimple does not pass these ECN fees on to the client.

### Can I open a Self-Directed RESP on Wealthsimple?

Yes. Wealthsimple recently launched Self-Directed RESPs, allowing you to trade stocks and ETFs inside an education savings plan commission-free. This closes a major gap, as previously only Questrade offered self-directed RESPs.

### Does Questrade offer fractional shares like Wealthsimple?

Yes, Questrade has introduced fractional share trading for many US and Canadian securities. However, Wealthsimple's fractional trading interface is often considered more user-friendly for beginners looking to dollar-cost average small amounts.

### Is the Questrade offer code better than the Wealthsimple referral bonus?

For most beginners, the Wealthsimple referral code is superior because it offers a $25 cash bonus with only a $1 minimum deposit. Questrade's welcome offers require a minimum deposit of $250 within 60 days of submitting the application.
