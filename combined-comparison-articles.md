# Article 1: Wealthsimple Crypto vs Newton vs Shakepay: Complete 2025 Comparison

**Author:** Isabelle Reuben  
**Published:** 2025-12-09

The Canadian crypto scene has changed. A lot.

Remember when we had to wire money to sketchy offshore exchanges and hope it actually arrived? Those days are gone. In 2025, it's really a three-horse race: **Wealthsimple Crypto**, **Newton**, and **Shakepay**.

So, which one is actually the best?

Here's the honest truth: **There isn't one.**

I've used all three. Each one is great at something specific, and terrible at something else. One is my go-to for regular buys. Another is where I hoard my long-term holds. And one is just for the altcoins I can't find anywhere else.

Here is the complete, no-fluff breakdown of Wealthsimple Crypto vs Newton vs Shakepay to help you figure out which one fits _you_.

## Quick Comparison Overview

| Feature             | Wealthsimple Crypto      | Newton                    | Shakepay                         |

## Fee Structure Analysis

Crypto fees are a headache. And companies love to hide them. Some charge a commission. Others hide their cut in the "spread" (the gap between the buy and sell price).

### Wealthsimple Crypto

Wealthsimple is transparent. They charge an operation fee on every trade. The percentage just depends on how much cash you have with them:

- **Core (Under $100k):** 2% fee
- **Premium ($100k+):** 1% fee
- **Generation ($500k+):** 0.5% fee

**Pros:** You know exactly what you're paying. If you're a Generation client, 0.5% is incredibly cheap for a platform this regulated.
**Cons:** If you're starting small (Core tier), that 2% fee hurts. A lot.

### Newton

Newton claims "no fees". But that's marketing speak. They make money on the spread.

- **Spread:** Usually **0.50% to 0.70%** for BTC/ETH, but can be 3-6% for less liquid altcoins
- **Surge Pricing:** Heads up—when the market goes crazy, these spreads can widen.

**Pros:** For the average person just trading altcoins, this is often the cheapest option.
**Cons:** The "no fee" tag is misleading. You are paying a fee; you just don't see it on a separate line.

### Shakepay

Shakepay is the easiest app to use. Period. But you pay for that convenience.

- **Spread:** Typically **1.5% to 2%**

**Pros:** They **cover withdrawal gas fees**. This is huge. I've saved hundreds of dollars in ETH gas fees just by using Shakepay.
**Cons:** Don't day trade here. The fees will eat you alive.

## Staking & Rewards

If you're holding for the long run, you might as well get paid for it.

### Wealthsimple Crypto: The Staking King

Wealthsimple lets you stake Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and Polkadot.

- **Yield:** Varies (currently ~3-5% for ETH).
- **Convenience:** It's one click. Seriously.
- **Cost:** They take a cut (30% for Core, 15% for Generation), but frankly, avoiding the technical headache of on-chain staking is worth it for most people.

### Shakepay: The "ShakingSats" Phenomenon

Shakepay doesn't do staking. But they have **ShakingSats**.

- **How it works:** Open the app. Shake your phone. Get free Bitcoin.
- **The catch:** You need a referral code to unlock it.
- **My take:** It sounds silly, but I do it every morning. It's small amounts, sure. But over a year? It adds up to a nice little stack of sats for literally zero effort.

### Newton

Newton is purely for trading. No staking. No shaking. Just buying and selling.

## Crypto Withdrawals: A Key Difference

This is the big one. Do you leave coins on the exchange, or move them to a cold wallet like a Ledger?

- **Shakepay (Winner):** They pay the miner fees. If you buy $50 of Bitcoin and send it to your wallet, you get the full value. This makes Shakepay the ultimate "on-ramp."
- **Newton:** You pay the network fees. For ETH, this can get pricey.
- **Wealthsimple:** You pay the standard network fees.

## The Verdict: Which Platform is For You?

Like I said, there isn't one winner. It depends on _you_.

### Choose Wealthsimple Crypto if:

You want it all in one place. If you already check Wealthsimple for your RRSP and stocks, seeing your crypto right next to it is just convenient. It's also the clear winner for **high-net-worth investors** who get those low fees, or anyone who wants **staking rewards** without the stress.

### Choose Newton if:

You're hunting for altcoins. Maybe you want SOL or DOT but don't have $100k for Wealthsimple Premium. With 70+ coins and tight spreads, Newton is the sweet spot for the average Canadian trader who wants variety without getting gouged.

### Choose Shakepay if:

You're a Bitcoin or Ethereum purist. And you love self-custody. The free withdrawals make it the perfect place to buy your BTC and immediately move it to your hardware wallet. Use the referral code, unlock ShakingSats, and get your free daily stats. It's a no-brainer.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Which platform is safer?

They're all solid. Wealthsimple Crypto is a CIRO-registered dealer—that's the gold standard for regulation here. Newton and Shakepay are registered with FINTRAC. Wealthsimple uses Gemini for custody with $200M insurance, which gives me a lot of peace of mind.

### How long does it take to unstake my crypto on Wealthsimple?

For Ethereum, there is a warm-up and unbonding period that can take several days to weeks depending on network congestion (usually a queue + ~27 hours). You won't be able to sell these assets until that period is over. So its not instant.

### Why can't I buy USDT (Tether) on Wealthsimple?

Tether (USDT) is the world's most popular stablecoin, but it is effectively banned on regulated Canadian platforms. Wealthsimple is a fully compliant restricted dealer under the OSC, meaning they only list approved assets like USDC.

### How do I get my crypto tax documents from Wealthsimple?

Preparing for taxes? If you're looking for **wealthsimple crypto tax documents for Koinly**, it's actually quite simple. Unlike some platforms that require complex API keys, Wealthsimple provides a dedicated "Crypto Realized Gain Loss Report" (CSV) in the app's documents section. You can simply download this file and upload it directly to Koinly.

### Is there a limit on how much crypto I can withdraw to my wallet on Wealthsimple?

Yes, there is a limit. For security, the **wealthsimple crypto withdrawal limit daily** is typically set around $10,000 CAD equivalent (or $25,000 weekly). This is important for "whales" or anyone moving large sums to self-custody. Competing platforms like Newton or Shakepay may have different limits, so check this if you plan to move high volumes frequently.

# Article 2: Wealthsimple vs Questrade Fees 2025: Complete Comparison

**Author:** Isabelle Reuben  
**Published:** 2025-12-01

The **Wealthsimple vs Questrade** question comes up constantly among Canadian DIY investors. And honestly? Both platforms have gotten a lot better in 2025. The real answer depends on how you actually invest.

## Quick Comparison Overview

| Feature                   | Wealthsimple           | Questrade                  |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Canadian Stock Trades** | $0                     | $0                         |
| **US Stock Trades**       | $0 (+ FX fee)          | $0                         |
| **ETF Purchases**         | $0                     | $0                         |
| **ETF Sells**             | $0                     | $0                         |
| **Options**               | $0 + $0.75-$2/contract | $0 + $0.99/contract        |
| **Currency Conversion**   | 1.5% (or USD account)  | 1.5% (or Norbert's Gambit) |
| **Robo-Advisor**          | 0.4%-0.5%              | 0.25% (Questwealth)        |
| **Account Minimum**       | $0                     | $0                         |
| **Mobile App**            | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐             | ⭐⭐⭐                     |

## Trading Fees: Both Are Now Commission-Free

As of early 2025, both Wealthsimple and Questrade offer **$0 commission trading** for Canadian and US stocks and ETFs.

### The History

- **Wealthsimple Trade:** Launched commission-free from the start
- **Questrade:** Eliminated commissions in February 2025 to compete

This levels the playing field for basic stock and ETF purchases. So where do the real differences show up? Currency conversion. Options. And the little details.

## Currency Conversion: This Is the Big One

Here's where the two platforms really differ—and if you're buying US stocks regularly, pay attention:

### Wealthsimple's Approach

**Standard (Core tier):** 1.5% FX fee on every US dollar conversion

- Buy $10,000 of NVIDIA → Pay $150 in FX
- Sell $10,000 of NVIDIA → Pay another $150 in FX
- Round-trip cost: **$300 (3%)**

**With USD Account:**

- Core: $10/month subscription
- Premium ($100K+): Free
- Generation ($500K+): Free

The USD Account lets you convert once and hold USD, eliminating per-trade conversion fees.

### Questrade's Approach

**Standard:** 1.99% FX fee (slightly higher than Wealthsimple's 1.5%)

**But with key advantages:**

1. **USD in Registered Accounts:** Questrade lets you hold USD in your TFSA, RRSP, etc.—all users, no subscription
2. **Norbert's Gambit:** Convert CAD to USD for virtually $0 using an interlisted security

### What Is Norbert's Gambit?

Norbert's Gambit is a technique to convert currency at minimal cost:

1. Buy a stock listed on both TSX (CAD) and NYSE (USD) — e.g., Royal Bank (RY)
2. Journal the shares from the CAD side to the USD side
3. Sell the shares for USD
4. Total cost: ~0.05% vs 1.5% with direct conversion

**Questrade actively supports this.** You can journal shares between currencies for minimal or no fee.

**Wealthsimple** has teased Norbert's Gambit support for early 2026, but as of late 2025, it's not yet available.

### Currency Conversion Verdict

| Your Situation                         | Better Platform              |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Only trade CAD stocks                  | Tie                          |
| Trade occasional US stocks             | Wealthsimple + USD Account   |
| Trade frequent US stocks (under $100K) | Questrade                    |
| Trade frequent US stocks ($100K+)      | Tie (both free USD)          |
| Large USD conversions                  | Questrade (Norbert's Gambit) |

## Options Trading Fees

Options trading is where active traders see meaningful differences:

|                      | Wealthsimple              | Questrade        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Commission**       | $0                        | $0               |
| **Per-Contract Fee** | $0.75-$2 USD              | $0.99 USD        |
| **Tier Pricing**     | Core: $2, Premium+: $0.75 | All users: $0.99 |

**Questrade wins** for Core-tier Wealthsimple users ($2 vs $0.99).

**Wealthsimple wins** for Premium/Generation users ($0.75 vs $0.99).

Both platforms now support advanced strategies like spreads and iron condors.

## Robo-Advisor: Managed Portfolios

If you prefer hands-off investing:

| Feature                |        Wealthsimple Invest | Questwealth |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------: | ----------: |
| **Minimum Investment** |                         $1 |        $250 |
| **Management Fee**     |                  0.4%-0.5% |       0.25% |
| **Features**           | Tax-loss harvesting, Halal | Rebalancing |

**Questwealth is cheaper** (0.25% vs 0.4-0.5%).

**Wealthsimple has more features** (automatic tax-loss harvesting, Halal portfolios, SRI options).

For a $50,000 portfolio:

- Wealthsimple: $250/year
- Questwealth: $125/year

The $125 difference—worth it for the extra features? Maybe. It depends on whether you'll actually use tax-loss harvesting and the SRI/Halal options.

## Platform Experience

### Mobile App

**Wealthsimple:** Consistently rated among the best financial apps in Canada. Clean, intuitive, fast.

**Questrade:** Functional but dated. The app works but isn't as polished.

**Winner: Wealthsimple** (significantly better UX)

### Desktop Trading

**Wealthsimple:** Web-based only. Works well but limited charting and analysis tools.

**Questrade:** Has IQ Edge, a full desktop trading platform with advanced features for active traders.

**Winner: Questrade** (for power users)

### Research & Tools

**Wealthsimple:** Basic company info, no advanced charting.

**Questrade:** More detailed research, better charting options, IQ Edge platform.

**Winner: Questrade** (for active traders)

## Transfer Fee Reimbursement

Both platforms will reimburse transfer-out fees from your old institution:

|                          | Wealthsimple    | Questrade          |
| ------------------------ | --------------- | ------------------ |
| **Minimum Transfer**     | $25,000         | $25,000            |
| **Reimbursement Speed**  | 2 business days | 5-10 business days |
| **Documentation Needed** | Automatic       | Sometimes required |

Both are comparable, with Wealthsimple being slightly faster.

## Banking & Cash Features

### Wealthsimple Cash

Wealthsimple goes beyond investing with its Chequing account:

- 0.75%-2.25% interest on cash
- No foreign transaction fees on card
- CDIC insurance up to $1 million (across partner banks)

### Questrade

No equivalent banking product. Cash in trading accounts doesn't earn competitive interest.

**Winner: Wealthsimple** — if you want everything in one app, this is where Wealthsimple pulls ahead.

## Crypto Trading

|                          | Wealthsimple | Questrade |
| ------------------------ | ------------ | --------- |
| **Direct Crypto**        | Yes (2% fee) | No        |
| **Crypto ETFs**          | Yes          | Yes       |
| **Withdrawal to Wallet** | Yes          | N/A       |

If you want direct crypto exposure in the same app as your stocks, Wealthsimple offers it. Questrade only offers crypto through ETFs.

## Who Should Choose Wealthsimple?

✅ **Wealthsimple makes sense if you:**

- Mostly stick to Canadian stocks and ETFs
- Want a clean, modern app that just works
- Like having investing + banking in one place
- Have $100K+ (Premium tier eliminates those USD fees)
- Want crypto alongside your regular investments
- Prefer simplicity over power features

## Who Should Choose Questrade?

✅ **Choose Questrade if you:**

- Actively trade US stocks
- Want to use Norbert's Gambit for currency conversion
- Need advanced desktop trading tools
- Prefer the lowest possible robo-advisor fees
- Trade options frequently at Core-tier levels

## What About Interactive Brokers?

Some advanced traders ask about Interactive Brokers (IBKR) as a third option. Here's the quick take:

| Factor             | Wealthsimple               | Questrade                      | Interactive Brokers          |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| **Target User**    | Beginners to intermediates | DIY investors                  | Professionals/Active traders |
| **Commission**     | $0                         | $0                             | $0.01/share (min $1)         |
| **USD Conversion** | 1.5% or USD Account        | Norbert's Gambit               | Best forex rates             |
| **Global Markets** | Canada, US only            | Canada, US, some international | 150+ markets worldwide       |
| **Interface**      | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Simple          | ⭐⭐⭐ Functional              | ⭐⭐ Complex                 |
| **Margin Rates**   | Higher                     | Moderate                       | Lowest in industry           |

**IBKR wins on:** Global market access, margin rates, execution quality, and professional tools.

**Wealthsimple wins on:** Ease of use, Canadian integration, banking features, and accessibility for new investors.

**The verdict:** Interactive Brokers is overkill for most Canadians. If you need access to European or Asian markets, complex options strategies, or institutional-level margin rates, IBKR makes sense. For everyone else, Wealthsimple or Questrade covers 95% of needs with a far friendlier experience.

And here's one more thing. Wealthsimple has a robust referral program that gives you **$25+ cash** just for signing up with a referral code.

Questrade has referral offers, but they're less consistent and typically require higher deposits. However, if you do decide to go with Questrade, you can use the referral code **406714313487116** or this [direct link](https://questmobile.onelink.me/tX0y/419708l0) to claim the welcome bonus (typically $50 for a $250 deposit).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Wealthsimple or Questrade cheaper?

For CAD investing, they're essentially identical. For USD investing, Questrade is cheaper unless you have $100K+ at Wealthsimple (which gives you free USD accounts).

### Which has better customer support?

Wealthsimple has faster, more accessible support via in-app chat. Questrade has phone support but longer wait times.

### When is Norbert's Gambit coming to Wealthsimple?

Wealthsimple has announced that support for Norbert's Gambit (a method to convert CAD to USD cheaply) is scheduled for release in early 2026. Until then, you must pay the 1.5% FX fee or subscribe to the USD accounts to avoid conversion fees on every trade.

### Do I pay ECN fees on Questrade ETF purchases?

Yes. Although Questrade offers $0 commission on ETF buys, you may still be charged ECN fees (roughly $0.0035 per share) if your order "removes liquidity" from the market (e.g., a marketable limit order or market order). Wealthsimple does not pass these ECN fees on to the client.

### Can I open a Self-Directed RESP on Wealthsimple?

Yes. Wealthsimple recently launched Self-Directed RESPs, allowing you to trade stocks and ETFs inside an education savings plan commission-free. This closes a major gap, as previously only Questrade offered self-directed RESPs.

### Does Questrade offer fractional shares like Wealthsimple?

Yes, Questrade has introduced fractional share trading for many US and Canadian securities. However, Wealthsimple's fractional trading interface is often considered more user-friendly for beginners looking to dollar-cost average small amounts.

### Is the Questrade offer code better than the Wealthsimple referral bonus?

For most beginners, the Wealthsimple referral code is superior because it offers a $25 cash bonus with only a $1 minimum deposit. Questrade's welcome offers require a minimum deposit of $250 within 60 days of submitting the application.
