faqs:
  - question: 'Can I combine assets with my spouse to reach Generation status?'
    answer: "Yes, through the Wealthsimple Household feature. A Household is limited to 2 people who share the same residential address. Combined totals determine your tier, but members only see the combined total - not each other's individual account balances or activity."
  - question: 'If the market drops my balance below $100k, do I lose Premium status?'
    answer: 'Wealthsimple generally protects you from market downturns. Your status is determined by net deposits OR total portfolio value, whichever is higher. You usually only risk downgrading if you withdraw funds that drop your net deposits below the threshold.'
  - question: 'Do I have to pay the $10 USD fee for each account separately?'
    answer: 'No. The single USD account fee covers all your eligible accounts (TFSA, RRSP, and Non-Registered). If you are Premium or Generation, this fee is waived entirely.'
  - question: 'Is my money locked in if I invest in Private Credit or Private Equity?'
    answer: 'Yes, these assets have different liquidity rules than stocks. They typically have specific monthly or quarterly redemption windows rather than instant selling.'
  - question: 'Do Generation clients still get DragonPass lounge access?'
    answer: 'Yes, but it is part of the Milestone Rewards system. Once you reach the required asset level, you can select the 10 DragonPass lounge visits as your reward for the year.'
  - question: 'Does TFSA + RRSP + Chequing all count toward tier status?'
    answer: 'Yes. All Wealthsimple accounts are combined when calculating your tier.'
  - question: 'Do referral bonuses count toward tier qualification?'
    answer: 'The Wealthsimple sign up bonus itself is cash, not deposits for tier purposes. However, any funds you deposit to receive the bonus do count toward your tier status.'

Wealthsimple isn't just a brokerage—it's actually a tiered ecosystem where your benefits get better as your account grows. As a Core client with two years of experience, I've watched my accounts grow toward that $100K threshold—so I've paid close attention to what each tier actually offers. If you're wondering whether it's worth pushing to hit that $100K or $500K threshold, this breakdown of **Wealthsimple Core vs Premium vs Generation** will help you figure out the real value.

## Quick Tier Overview

| Feature                | Core ($0-$99K)  | Premium ($100K+)   | Generation ($500K+) |
| ---------------------- | --------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| **Management Fee**     | 0.50%           | 0.40%              | 0.20%-0.40%         |
| **Cash Interest**      | 0.75%-1.25%\*   | 1.75%              | 2.25% (max)         |
| **USD Account**        | $10/month       | Free               | Free                |
| **Crypto Fees**        | 2.0%            | 1.0%               | 0.5%                |
| **Crypto Staking Cut** | 30%             | 20%                | 15%                 |
| **Options Trading**    | $2 USD/contract | $0.75 USD/contract | $0.75 USD/contract  |
| **Referral Eligible**  | ✅ Yes          | ✅ Yes             | ✅ Yes              |

## Core Tier ($0 - $99,999)

The **Core** tier is where everyone starts—and honestly, it's pretty solid on its own. I've been a Core client since opening my accounts, and while I'm aware of the limitations, it works well for my current needs. Here's what you get when you're just starting out or building up your portfolio:

### What You Get

**Stock & ETF Trading:**

- $0 commission on all Canadian stocks and ETFs
- $0 commission on US stocks and ETFs (with FX caveat)

**Managed Investing:**

- 0.50% annual management fee
- Automatic rebalancing and dividend reinvestment

**Banking:**

- 0.75% base interest on Chequing balance
- Can boost to 1.25% with $2,000+/month direct deposit

**Crypto:**

- 2% trading fee per transaction
- Access to major cryptocurrencies

### The Hidden Cost: USD Trading

Okay, here's the catch for Core users—there's a **1.5% currency conversion fee** every time you touch US stocks.[^1] This is the main limitation I've noticed in my own trading—I've mostly stuck to Canadian ETFs to avoid these fees.

**Example:** Buying $10,000 of Apple stock:

- FX fee: $150 (buy) + $150 (sell) = **$300 round-trip cost**

The workaround? The **USD Account** for $10/month, which lets you hold USD and avoid per-trade conversion.[^1]

For someone trading US stocks monthly, this makes sense:

- Without USD Account: $300+ per trade in FX fees
- With USD Account: $120/year flat fee

### Is Core Good Enough?

**Yes, if you:**

- Only invest in Canadian stocks and ETFs
- Have less than $100K in total assets
- Don't actively trade US equities

**No, if you:**

- Frequently trade US stocks
- Have approaching $100K and want lower fees
- Want higher interest on cash

## Premium Tier ($100,000+)

**Premium** is really the "sweet spot" for serious investors in Canada. Hit $100,000 in net deposits across all your Wealthsimple accounts, and you'll unlock these upgrades automatically.

### What Changes at Premium

**Free USD Account:**

- Saves $120/year immediately
- More importantly, eliminates the need to convert on every US trade

**Lower Management Fee:**

- Drops from 0.50% to 0.40%
- Saves $100/year on a $100,000 portfolio

**Higher Cash Interest:**

- Base rate: 1.75% (vs 0.75%-1.25% for Core)
- With direct deposit: boosted up to the current maximum of 2.25%

**Reduced Crypto Fees:**

- Trading fee drops from 2% to 1%
- Staking reward cut reduced from 30% to 20%

**Better Options Pricing:**

- Per-contract fee drops from $2 to $0.75 USD

**Priority Support:**

- Faster email and phone response times

### Is Premium Worth It at $100K?

Let's do the math for a typical $100K portfolio:

| Benefit                               | Annual Value |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Management fee savings (0.1% × $100K) | $100         |
| Free USD Account                      | $120         |
| Higher cash interest (on $5K cash)    | ~$25         |
| **Total Annual Savings**              | **~$245**    |

**Our take: Premium is absolutely worth it at $100K.** The benefits kick in automatically—you don't have to do anything once you hit the threshold. For most Canadians investing in US stocks, the free USD account alone pays for itself.

If you're close to $100K, consider consolidating accounts to reach Premium faster—it's exactly what I'm planning as my portfolio grows.

## Generation Tier ($500,000+)

**Generation** is Wealthsimple's answer to private banking. It targets high-net-worth individuals who might otherwise use full-service wealth managers.

### What Changes at Generation

**Lowest Fees Possible:**

- Management fee: 0.40% at $500K, scaling down to 0.20% at $10M+
- That's $1,000-$2,000 saved annually on a $500K portfolio

**Maximum Cash Interest:**

- 2.25% rate (the highest available)[^2]
- Note: This is the maximum—Wealthsimple explicitly caps interest at 2.25% and rates cannot be stacked beyond this

**Lowest Crypto Fees:**

- Trading fee: 0.5%
- Staking reward cut: 15%

**Private Asset Access:**

- Private credit funds
- Private equity investments
- **Summit Portfolio** — Wealthsimple's flagship offering for Generation clients, combining public and private assets in a single managed portfolio
- Previously only available to institutional investors with $1M+ minimums

**Lifestyle Perks:**

- 50% off Medcan health plans[^3]
- Partner rewards (Uber One, Strava Premium, etc.)
- Dedicated financial advisor access
- Estate planning services

**Credit Card Benefits:**

- Wealthsimple Visa Infinite annual fee waived ($240/year value)[^4]

### Is Generation Worth Pursuing?

If you're naturally growing to $500K through investing, the benefits are automatic and significant.

**Actively chasing $500K just for Generation status?** That depends:

- Don't move money into worse investments just to hit the threshold
- The math: $500K × 0.1% fee savings = $500/year
- Combined with other perks, Generation clients save $1,000+ annually

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I combine assets with my spouse to reach Generation status?

Yes, through the **Wealthsimple Household** feature.[^5] A Household is limited to 2 people who share the same residential address. Once linked, Wealthsimple combines your total assets to calculate your tier. For example, if you have $300,000 and your partner has $200,000, you will both be upgraded to Generation status and unlock the 2.25% interest rate and other perks.

> **Privacy note:** Household members can only see the combined total—they cannot access each other's individual account balances or activity.

### If the market drops my balance below $100k, do I lose Premium status?

Wealthsimple generally protects you from market downturns. Your status is determined by net deposits OR total portfolio value—whichever is higher. If you deposit $100,000 and the market drops your value to $90,000, you typically maintain Premium status. You usually only risk downgrading if you withdraw funds that drop your net deposits below the threshold.

### Do I have to pay the $10 USD fee for each account separately?

No. If you are a Core client paying for the USD account subscription ($10/month), that single fee covers all your eligible accounts (TFSA, RRSP, and Non-Registered). You do not need to pay per account. If you are Premium or Generation, this fee is waived entirely for all accounts.

### Is my money locked in if I invest in Private Credit or Private Equity?

Yes, these assets have different liquidity rules than stocks. Unlike ETFs which can be sold instantly during market hours, Private Credit and Private Equity funds typically have specific monthly or quarterly "redemption windows." In times of high market stress, there may be limits on how much can be withdrawn at once.

### Do Generation clients still get DragonPass lounge access?

Yes, but it is part of the "Milestone Rewards" system. Once you reach the required asset level, you can select the 10 DragonPass lounge visits as your reward for the year. This is separate from any lounge access provided by the Wealthsimple Visa Infinite Privilege card.

### Does TFSA + RRSP + Chequing all count toward tier status?

Yes. All Wealthsimple accounts are combined when calculating your tier.

### Do referral bonuses count toward tier qualification?

The Wealthsimple sign up bonus itself is cash, not "deposits" for tier purposes. However, any funds you deposit to receive the bonus do count toward your tier status.

  - question: 'Comment puis-je passer au palier Premium ?'
    answer: 'Vous passez automatiquement au palier Premium lorsque vos dépôts nets atteignent 100 000 $. Aucune action requise—le système met à jour votre statut automatiquement.'
  - question: 'Les dépôts nets incluent-ils mes gains de placement ?'
    answer: 'Non, les dépôts nets sont calculés comme vos dépôts totaux moins vos retraits totaux. Les gains ou pertes de marché ne comptent pas.'
  - question: "Puis-je rétrograder si je retire de l'argent ?"
    answer: 'Oui, si vos dépôts nets tombent sous le seuil du palier, vous serez rétrogradé au palier inférieur lors du prochain cycle de calcul.'
  - question: 'Le palier Premium en vaut-il la peine juste pour le compte USD gratuit ?'
    answer: "Si vous négociez fréquemment des actions américaines, le compte USD gratuit économise 1,5 % sur chaque conversion. Sur 10 000 $ de transactions USD annuellement, c'est 150 $ d'économies, ce qui dépasse les 120 $/an que coûterait le compte USD pour un client Core."

Le système de paliers de Wealthsimple détermine vos frais, avantages et expérience globale. Comprendre les différences vous aide à savoir si viser un palier supérieur vaut l'effort. Voici exactement ce que vous obtenez à chaque niveau.

## Les trois paliers en un coup d'œil

| Fonctionnalité                | Core (0-99 K$) | Premium (100 K$+) | Génération (500 K$+) |

| **Frais crypto**              | 2,00 %         | 1,00 %            | 0,50 %               |
| **Retenue staking crypto**    | 30 %           | 20 %              | 15 %                 |

| **Actifs privés**             | Non            | Non               | Oui                  |
| **Conseiller dédié**          | Non            | Non               | Oui                  |
| **Admissible au parrainage**  | ✅ Oui         | ✅ Oui            | ✅ Oui               |

## Palier Core : Le point de départ

Core est là où tout le monde commence. Avec des dépôts nets sous 100 000 $, vous obtenez :

### Ce qui est inclus

- **Accès complet à la plateforme** à tous les produits Wealthsimple
- **0 $ de commissions actions/FNB** (même que les paliers supérieurs)
- **Frais crypto standard** (2 %)
- **Compte Cash** avec intérêt de base (0,75 %)
- **Carte Wealthsimple** sans frais de transaction étrangère

### Ce qui coûte extra

- **Compte USD :** 10 $/mois (ou 1,5 % par conversion sans compte USD)
- **Investissement géré :** 0,50 % de frais annuels

### Pour qui Core est idéal

La plupart des Canadiens resteront au palier Core, et c'est parfaitement correct. Si vous :

- Investissez principalement dans des actions/FNB canadiens
- Avez un portefeuille sous 100 000 $
- N'utilisez pas fréquemment les fonctionnalités USD

Core offre tout ce dont vous avez besoin sans frais supplémentaires.

## Palier Premium : L'option idéale

À 100 000 $+ en dépôts nets, Premium débloque une valeur significative. C'est le palier optimal pour beaucoup d'investisseurs canadiens sérieux.

### Ce qui est inclus (en plus de Core)

- **Compte USD gratuit** (économise 120 $/an vs Core)
- **Frais d'investissement géré plus bas** (0,40 % vs 0,50 %)
- **Frais crypto réduits** (1,00 % vs 2,00 %)
- **Intérêt Cash plus élevé** (1,75 % de base, jusqu'à 2,25 % avec dépôt direct)
- **Soutien prioritaire** avec temps d'attente réduit

### L'économie réelle

Voici ce que vous économisez en passant de Core à Premium sur un portefeuille de 100 000 $ :

| Fonctionnalité          | Core     | Premium  | Économie annuelle |
| ----------------------- | -------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| Investissement géré     | 500 $/an | 400 $/an | **100 $**         |
| Compte USD              | 120 $/an | 0 $/an   | **120 $**         |
| Intérêt Cash (sur 10K$) | 75 $/an  | 175 $/an | **100 $**         |
| **Total**               |          |          | **320 $/an**      |

### Pour qui Premium est idéal

Premium a du sens si vous :

- Consolidez des actifs de plusieurs institutions
- Négociez régulièrement des actions américaines
- Utilisez l'investissement géré de Wealthsimple
- Gardez un solde significatif dans votre compte Cash

## Palier Génération : L'expérience complète

À 500 000 $+, Génération fournit le niveau de service le plus élevé. C'est conçu pour les clients fortunés qui veulent une relation plus personnalisée.

### Ce qui est inclus (en plus de Premium)

- **Les frais les plus bas sur tous les produits**
  - Investissement géré : 0,20 % - 0,40 % (selon le montant)
  - Crypto : 0,50 %
- **Accès aux investissements en crédit privé**
- **Conseiller dédié**
- **Intérêt Cash maximum** (2,25 % garanti)
- **Avantages de style de vie** (événements exclusifs, partenariats)

### Investissements privés

Le gros avantage de Génération est l'accès aux actifs privés—des investissements normalement réservés aux clients institutionnels :

- **Crédit privé :** Rendements plus élevés que les obligations traditionnelles
- **Immobilier privé :** Exposition immobilière diversifiée
- **Capital-investissement :** Accès à des entreprises non cotées (limité)

Ces investissements peuvent aider à diversifier au-delà des marchés publics traditionnels.

### L'économie de Génération

Sur un portefeuille de 500 000 $ :

| Fonctionnalité      | Premium    | Génération | Économie annuelle |
| ------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| Investissement géré | 2 000 $/an | 1 500 $/an | **500 $**         |
| Crypto (sur 10K$)   | 100 $/an   | 50 $/an    | **50 $**          |
| **Total**           |            |            | **550 $+/an**     |

Plus l'accès aux investissements privés et au service personnalisé.

## Comment les seuils sont calculés

### Dépôts nets expliqués

Les paliers sont basés sur vos **dépôts nets**, pas la valeur de votre compte :
```

Dépôts nets = Dépôts totaux − Retraits totaux

```

Cela signifie :
- Les gains de marché ne comptent pas vers le palier supérieur
- Les pertes de marché ne vous font pas rétrograder
- Seuls les mouvements d'argent réel comptent

### Exemple

Vous déposez 100 000 $, et votre portefeuille monte à 150 000 $ :
- **Dépôts nets :** 100 000 $ (vous êtes Premium)
- **Valeur du compte :** 150 000 $

Votre portefeuille baisse à 80 000 $ :
- **Dépôts nets :** Toujours 100 000 $ (vous restez Premium)
- **Valeur du compte :** 80 000 $

## Stratégies pour atteindre le palier supérieur

### Pour atteindre Premium (100 K$)

1. **Consolidez vos comptes :** Transférez REER, CELI et non-enregistré d'autres institutions
2. **Maximisez vos cotisations :** CELI (7 000 $) + REER + CELIAPP s'accumulent rapidement
3. **Transférez pour le remboursement des frais :** Transferts de 25 000 $+ = frais remboursés

### Pour atteindre Génération (500 K$)

1. **Patrimoine familial :** Certains clients combinent les comptes familiaux
2. **Transferts de succession :** Héritages peuvent vous qualifier rapidement
3. **Vente d'entreprise :** Produits de vente d'entreprise

## Le verdict

### La plupart des Canadiens seront satisfaits avec Core

Si vous êtes un investisseur typique avec moins de 100 000 $ et investissez principalement dans des FNB canadiens, Core vous offre tout ce dont vous avez besoin. Les 0 $ de commissions et l'excellente application sont les mêmes que les paliers supérieurs.

### Premium vaut la peine si vous consolidez
