  - question: 'What if I withdraw my original deposit but leave the bonus?'
    answer: 'If you try to withdraw any funds (even your original deposit) within 180 days, the bonus may be deducted.'
  - question: 'Is there a limit to how many people I can refer?'
    answer: 'No. Once you are a Wealthsimple client, you can refer unlimited friends and earn at least $25 for each successful referral.'
  - question: 'Is the Wealthsimple sign up bonus worth it?'
    answer: 'Absolutely. For a $1 minimum deposit, you get $25 in free cash. If you are transferring larger amounts, the bonus scales up to $5,000, making it one of the best sign up bonuses in Canadian fintech.'
  - question: 'Do I get a T5 or T4A slip for my referral bonus?'
    answer: 'No. Wealthsimple generally does not issue tax slips for referral bonuses. However, you are still responsible for reporting it to the CRA as other income if required.'
  - question: 'Will I lose my bonus if my portfolio drops below the deposit requirement?'
    answer: 'Generally, no. The clawback policy applies to withdrawals, not market performance. You only risk losing it if you actively withdraw funds during the hold period.'

    answer: 'The primary account holder making the contributions is considered the client for the referral program. They must enter the referral code and meet funding requirements.'
  - question: 'Is there a special Wealthsimple referral code for students?'
    answer: 'No, but the standard referral code is ideal for students because it triggers the $25 cash bonus with only a $1 minimum deposit.'
  - question: 'I have a TFSA. Can I use a code if I open a new RRSP?'
    answer: 'No. The referral program is strictly for new clients who have never had a Wealthsimple investment or chequing account before.'
  - question: 'I only use Wealthsimple Tax. Am I still eligible for a referral bonus?'
    answer: 'Yes. The new client definition only covers investment and chequing products, not Wealthsimple Tax. Tax-only users are still considered new for the referral program.'

Before claiming your Wealthsimple sign up bonus, it's important to understand the terms and conditions. This guide breaks down the fine print in plain English so you know exactly what to expect from your referral bonus.

## Eligibility Requirements

### Who Can Receive a Referral Bonus?

To qualify for the **Wealthsimple sign up bonus** of $25 (or higher tier), you must meet ALL of the following criteria:

| Requirement            | Details                                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **New Client Status**  | Never opened a Self-directed, Crypto, Managed Investing, or Chequing account |
| **Canadian Residency** | Must be a legal resident of Canada                                           |
| **Age of Majority**    | Must be 18+ (19+ in some provinces)                                          |
| **Account Standing**   | Must be able to pass identity verification                                   |

My identity verification took less than 5 minutes—I just had to snap a photo of my ID and a selfie. It was much smoother than the manual verification I had to do with my traditional bank.

### What Counts as a "New Client"?

- Completed identity verification for any of the above products
- Started registration and funded any investment product

**Personal note:** I actually started as a Wealthsimple Tax user before ever opening a Cash account. I was worried I wouldn't count as a "new client" for the $25 bonus, but the terms are very specific—Tax doesn't count against you. My bonus landed in my account perfectly within 24 hours of my first $100 deposit.[^1]

...you're not considered new for the referral program. Wealthsimple's definition of "new client" is tied specifically to **Self-directed, Crypto, Managed Investing, or Chequing accounts**. These are the only products that "count" for the new client definition.

> **Good news for Tax users:** Using Wealthsimple Tax alone doesn't disqualify you. The official "new client" definition is explicitly limited to investment and chequing products—the tax product is not mentioned. If you've only ever used Wealthsimple Tax to file your returns, you're likely still eligible for the $25 bonus when you open and fund your first investment account.

> **Reactivation offers:** Some users who signed up years ago and never engaged may receive special "reactivation" offers with different terms.

## Funding Requirements

### Minimum Deposit: Just $1

One of the most attractive aspects of Wealthsimple's referral program is the **$1 minimum deposit**. Unlike competitors who require $100 or more, Wealthsimple makes it accessible to everyone.

### 30-Day Funding Window

You must fund your account within **30 days** of:

- Entering the referral code, OR
- Opening your account (AND if the code was applied during signup)

If you miss this window, the referral relationship expires and no bonus is paid to either party.

> **Exception:** If you're doing an institutional transfer (RRSP, TFSA, LIRA from another bank), you get a **90-day window** instead. This accounts for the fact that bank-to-bank transfers can take 2-4 weeks.[^2]

### Where Can the Deposit Go?

Your qualifying deposit can go into any of these account types:

- ✅ Self-directed Trading account
- ✅ Managed Investing (robo-advisor)
- ✅ Crypto account
- ✅ Chequing account
- ✅ TFSA, RRSP, FHSA, or other registered accounts

## Bonus Payment Details

### When You'll Receive Your Bonus

Most users receive their referral bonus within **24 hours** of making a qualifying deposit. In rare cases, it may take up to a few business days.

### Where the Bonus Is Deposited

Your bonus is deposited into your **Wealthsimple Chequing account**, not your investment account.

**Why?** This is intentional. If the bonus went into your TFSA or RRSP, it would count as a contribution and use up your contribution room. By depositing it into Chequing:

- No contribution room is affected
- You can access it immediately
- You can move it wherever you want

> **Important:** If you don't have a Chequing account open, Wealthsimple may give you a grace period (typically 30-90 days) to open one. Otherwise, you might not receive your bonus.

### The 180-Day Hold Period

Here's a critical detail many people miss: **you must keep the bonus in your Wealthsimple account for 180 days**.

What happens if you withdraw early?

- The bonus amount may be **deducted from your withdrawal**
- This applies even if you're withdrawing from a different account than where the bonus was deposited

**Example:** You receive a $25 bonus in your Chequing account but later withdraw $500 from your TFSA within 180 days. Wealthsimple may deduct $25 from that withdrawal.[^1]

**Personal note:** I’ve seen some people get caught out by this. They think that since they have $10,000 in the account, withdrawing $100 won't matter. But the terms are clear: _any_ withdrawal within that first 180 days can trigger a clawback of the bonus. I just treat that bonus as "locked" for the first six months to be safe.

## Referral Ladder Bonuses

For deposits larger than $1,000, additional bonus tiers apply:

| Deposit Amount      | Total Bonus |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| $1 – $999           | $25         |
| $1,000 – $9,999     | $50         |
| $10,000 – $49,999   | $100        |
| $50,000 – $99,999   | $200        |
| $100,000 – $499,999 | $500        |
| $500,000 – $999,999 | $1,500      |
| $1,000,000+         | $5,000      |

### Extended Funding Period for Transfers

If you're transferring assets from another institution, you get extra time:

- **Standard deposits:** 30 days
- **Institutional transfers:** Up to 90 days

This accommodation exists because bank transfers can take 2-4 weeks to complete, and Wealthsimple doesn't want you penalized for your old bank's slow processing.

## Tax Implications

### No Tax Slips Issued

Wealthsimple **does not issue tax slips** (like T4A) for referral bonuses. However, this doesn't mean the income is tax-free.[^3]

### Your Reporting Responsibility

Technically, referral bonuses may be considered taxable income. Whether you need to report it depends on:

- Your overall tax situation
- The total amount received
- Whether you're treating it as casual income or part of a business

Most individual users receiving one-time $25 bonuses don't report them separately, but consult a tax professional if you're earning significant amounts through referrals.

### Why Bonuses Go to Chequing, Not TFSA

If your $25 bonus was deposited directly into your TFSA, it would:

- Count as a contribution
- Use up $25 of your contribution room
- Potentially cause over-contribution if you're near your limit

By depositing to Chequing, Wealthsimple avoids this problem entirely.

## Disqualification Scenarios

Your referral may be rejected if:

| Scenario                                              | Result                         |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---- |
| Previously opened any Wealthsimple investment account | Ineligible                     |
| Failed identity verification                          | No bonus until resolved        |
| Funded after 30-day window                            | Referral expires               |
| Attempted to refer yourself                           | Both accounts may be suspended | [^1] |
| Used fraudulent information                           | Account closure                |

### Self-Referral Is Not Allowed

Attempting to create multiple accounts to refer yourself is against the terms and can result in:

- Forfeiture of all bonuses
- Account suspension
- Permanent ban from the platform

## Quebec Residents

Most Wealthsimple promotions and referral bonuses are available to Quebec residents, but **some specific promotions may be excluded**. Always check the specific terms of any promotion if you're in Quebec.

## Getting Your Bonus: Quick Checklist

Before signing up, make sure you can check all these boxes:

- [ ] I've never had a Wealthsimple investment account
- [ ] I'm a Canadian resident of legal age
- [ ] I will fund my account within 30 days
- [ ] I have (or will open) a Wealthsimple Chequing account
- [ ] I won't withdraw the bonus for 180 days

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What if I withdraw my original deposit but leave the bonus?

If you try to withdraw any funds (even your original deposit) within 180 days, the bonus may be deducted.

### Is there a limit to how many people I can refer?

No. Once you're a Wealthsimple client, you can refer unlimited friends and earn at least $25 for each successful referral.

### Is the Wealthsimple sign up bonus worth it?

Absolutely. For a $1 minimum deposit, you get $25 in free cash—that's an instant 2,500% return. If you're transferring larger amounts, the bonus scales up to $5,000, making it one of the best sign up bonuses in Canadian fintech.

### Do I get a T5 or T4A slip for my referral bonus?

No. Wealthsimple generally does not issue tax slips (like a T5 or T4A) for referral bonuses paid into non-registered accounts (like your Cash account). However, this does not mean the income is tax-free; you are still responsible for reporting it to the CRA as "other income" if required.

### Will I lose my bonus if my portfolio drops below the deposit requirement?

Generally, no. Wealthsimple's clawback policy applies to withdrawals, not market performance. If you deposit the required funds and the market value drops, you typically keep your bonus. You only risk losing it if you actively withdraw funds that bring your net deposits below the threshold during the hold period.

### Who gets the bonus if I open a Spousal RRSP?

In a Spousal RRSP, the primary account holder (the person making the contributions) is considered the client for the referral program. They must be the one to enter the referral code and meet the funding requirements to earn the bonus.

### Is there a special Wealthsimple referral code for students?

No. However, the standard referral code (9C6DMQ) is highly recommended for students because it triggers the $25 cash bonus with a minimum deposit of only $1. This low barrier to entry makes it accessible even on a student budget.

### I have a TFSA. Can I use a code if I open a new RRSP?

No. The referral program is strictly for new clients who have never had a Wealthsimple investment or chequing account before. If you already hold any Wealthsimple investment account (Self-directed, Crypto, Managed) or Chequing account, opening a secondary account type (like an RRSP) does not make you eligible for a new client referral bonus.

### I only use Wealthsimple Tax. Am I still eligible for a referral bonus?

Yes, in most cases. The official referral terms define a "new client" as someone who has not previously opened a Self-directed, Crypto, Managed Investing, or Chequing account. Wealthsimple Tax is notably absent from this definition. If you've only ever used Wealthsimple Tax to file your returns, you're likely still considered a new client and can claim the $25 bonus when you open and fund your first investment account.

---

Avant de réclamer votre prime d'inscription Wealthsimple, il est important de comprendre les conditions générales. Ces règles déterminent qui est admissible, combien vous devez déposer, et combien de temps vous devez garder votre argent. Voici tout ce que vous devez savoir.

## Exigences d'admissibilité

### Qui peut recevoir une prime de parrainage ?

| Exigence                  | Détails                                                                                   |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Statut nouveau client** | N'avoir jamais ouvert de compte Placements autonomes, Crypto, Investissement géré ou Cash |
| **Résidence canadienne**  | Doit être un résident légal du Canada                                                     |
| **Âge de la majorité**    | Doit avoir 18+ ans (19+ dans certaines provinces)                                         |
| **Statut du compte**      | Doit pouvoir passer la vérification d'identité                                            |

### Qu'est-ce qu'un « nouveau client » ?

Wealthsimple définit un nouveau client comme quelqu'un qui n'a **jamais** ouvert l'un des comptes suivants :

- Placements autonomes (CELI, REER, non enregistré, etc.)
- Investissement géré (robot-conseiller)
- Crypto
- Cash (compte chèques)

**Exception importante :** Si vous avez utilisé **Wealthsimple Impôt** (anciennement SimpleTax) pour produire vos impôts, vous êtes probablement encore admissible. Wealthsimple Impôt n'est pas considéré comme un « compte » aux fins du programme de parrainage.

### Résidence et âge

- Vous devez être un **résident canadien** avec une adresse au Canada
- Vous devez avoir atteint l'**âge de la majorité** dans votre province :
  - 18 ans : Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, Québec, Saskatchewan, Î.-P.-É.
  - 19 ans : Colombie-Britannique, Nouveau-Brunswick, Terre-Neuve, Nouvelle-Écosse, Territoires

## Exigences d'approvisionnement

### Dépôt minimum : Seulement 1 $

Le programme de parrainage Wealthsimple exige seulement un **dépôt minimum de 1 $**. C'est l'un des seuils les plus bas de l'industrie—essentiellement de l'argent gratuit.

### Fenêtre d'approvisionnement de 30 jours

Vous devez approvisionner votre compte dans les **30 jours** suivant l'entrée du code de parrainage. Le compte à rebours commence quand :

- Vous cliquez sur un lien de parrainage et créez un compte, OU
- Vous entrez manuellement un code de parrainage dans l'application

### Types de dépôts admissibles

Votre dépôt peut aller dans n'importe quel compte Wealthsimple :

- **Transactions autogérées :** CELI, REER, REEE, CELIAPP, non enregistré
- **Investissement géré :** Tous les comptes de robot-conseiller
- **Crypto :** Compte de crypto-monnaies
- **Cash :** Compte chèques à intérêt élevé

### Transferts institutionnels (fenêtre prolongée)

Si vous transférez des actifs depuis une autre institution (comme une banque ou un autre courtier), vous avez une **fenêtre prolongée de 90 jours** au lieu de 30. Cela reconnaît que les transferts institutionnels peuvent prendre des semaines à compléter.

## Détails du paiement de la prime

### Montant de la prime

Pour les nouveaux clients utilisant un code de parrainage :

| Votre dépôt | Votre prime |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 1 $ ou plus | **25 $**    |

C'est un montant fixe—que vous déposiez 1 $ ou 10 000 $, vous recevez la même prime de 25 $.

### Où la prime est déposée

Votre prime est déposée dans votre **compte Wealthsimple Cash** (pas dans vos comptes de placement). Cela signifie :

- Elle n'affecte pas vos droits de cotisation au CELI ou au REER
- Vous pouvez la dépenser immédiatement avec votre carte Wealthsimple
- Elle gagne l'intérêt du compte Cash

### Délai de paiement

Wealthsimple vise à payer les primes **dans les 24 heures** suivant votre dépôt admissible. D'après notre expérience :

- La plupart des utilisateurs reçoivent leur prime le jour même
- Certains en quelques heures seulement
- Les cas complexes peuvent prendre 5-10 jours ouvrables

Si vous n'avez pas reçu votre prime après 10 jours ouvrables, contactez le soutien Wealthsimple.

## La période de conservation de 180 jours

### Comment ça fonctionne

Vous devez garder la prime dans votre compte Wealthsimple pendant **180 jours** (environ 6 mois). Si vous effectuez un retrait prématuré, la prime peut être **récupérée sur votre retrait**.

### Ce qui déclenche la récupération

- Retirer de l'argent de votre compte Cash
- Transférer des actifs vers une autre institution
- Fermer votre compte

### Ce qui NE déclenche PAS la récupération

- **Pertes de marché :** Si votre portefeuille baisse à cause du marché, vous ne perdez pas la prime
- **Transactions internes :** Déplacer de l'argent entre vos comptes Wealthsimple
- **Utiliser votre carte :** Dépenser avec votre carte Wealthsimple

### Exemple de récupération

Vous déposez 100 $ et recevez 25 $ de prime. Après 30 jours, vous essayez de retirer 80 $ :

- Votre retrait sera de 80 $ − 25 $ = **55 $**
- La prime de 25 $ est récupérée

Si vous attendez les 180 jours complets, vous pouvez retirer le montant total sans déduction.

## Implications fiscales

### Aucun feuillet d'impôt émis

Wealthsimple **n'émet pas de feuillets d'impôt** (T5 ou T4A) pour les primes de parrainage. Cela diffère de certaines autres institutions financières.

### Votre responsabilité de déclaration

Même sans feuillet, vous **pouvez être responsable** de déclarer cette prime comme revenu à l'ARC. Les primes de parrainage sont généralement considérées comme « autre revenu ».

Cependant, pour un montant de 25 $, l'impact fiscal est minime (quelques dollars au plus), et beaucoup de Canadiens ne le déclarent pas explicitement. Consultez un professionnel de l'impôt si vous avez des préoccupations.

## Règles pour les parrains

### Combien les parrains gagnent

Si vous êtes un client existant qui parraine de nouveaux utilisateurs, vos primes sont basées sur le montant déposé par votre ami :

| Dépôt de votre ami    | Votre prime |
| --------------------- | ----------- |
| 1 $ – 999 $           | 25 $        |
| 1 000 $ – 9 999 $     | 50 $        |
| 10 000 $ – 49 999 $   | 100 $       |
| 50 000 $ – 99 999 $   | 200 $       |
| 100 000 $ – 499 999 $ | 500 $       |
| 500 000 $ – 999 999 $ | 1 500 $     |
| 1 000 000 $+          | 5 000 $     |

### Pas de limite de parrainages

Il n'y a **aucune limite** au nombre de personnes que vous pouvez parrainer. Certains utilisateurs actifs sur Reddit rapportent avoir gagné des milliers de dollars en primes de parrainage.

### Même période de conservation

Les parrains sont également soumis à la période de conservation de 180 jours. Si votre ami retire ses fonds tôt, votre prime peut aussi être récupérée.

## Situations spéciales

### Comptes conjoints

Les deux titulaires d'un compte conjoint doivent être de nouveaux clients pour que le compte soit admissible. Le code de parrainage s'applique au compte, pas aux individus.

### Comptes entreprise

Les comptes entreprise **sont admissibles** aux primes de parrainage. La prime est généralement déposée dans le compte personnel du négociateur autorisé.

### REER de conjoint

Le titulaire principal du compte (qui fait les cotisations) est considéré comme le client pour le programme. Cette personne doit entrer le code et satisfaire aux exigences.

### Réouverture de compte

Si vous aviez un compte Wealthsimple dans le passé et l'avez fermé, vous n'êtes **pas admissible** comme nouveau client. Le système reconnaît votre NAS ou adresse courriel.

## Résumé des règles clés

| Règle                       | Détail                            |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Dépôt minimum**           | 1 $                               |
