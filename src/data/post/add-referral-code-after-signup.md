faqs:
  - question: 'I opened my account months ago but never funded it. Can I still add a code?'
    answer: 'Yes. If you opened an account but never deposited any money, you are still considered a new client. You can enter a referral code at any time before you fund. Once applied, you have 30 days to fund—but if that lapses, you can simply reapply the code for another 30-day window.'
  - question: 'Can customer support add the code for me if I missed the 7-day window?'
    answer: 'Generally, no. Wealthsimple system is designed to hard-lock the referral option exactly 7 days after your first deposit lands. Customer support typically cannot override this limit.'
  - question: 'I clicked a referral link to sign up. Do I still need to enter the code manually?'
    answer: 'Usually no, the link should apply the code automatically. However, verify by checking the Referrals section for a banner saying You were referred by someone. If not visible, enter code 9C6DMQ manually.'
  - question: 'Why am I getting an invalid code error?'
    answer: 'This usually happens because you are not a new client (had an old account linked to your email or SIN), or the 7-day window has passed since your first deposit.'
  - question: 'I added the code and funded $1. Why have I not received my bonus yet?'
    answer: 'While Wealthsimple aims to pay the $25 bonus within 24 hours, it can sometimes take up to 5-10 business days if verification is needed. Larger bonuses may take up to 14 days.'
  - question: 'What if I made a mistake entering my referral code?'
    answer: 'Contact Wealthsimple support to see if they can correct it. This is easier to fix than adding a new code after the window closes.'
  - question: 'Will I lose my sign up bonus if I withdraw money?'
    answer: 'If you withdraw funds within 180 days of receiving your bonus, the bonus amount may be deducted from your withdrawal.'

Did you sign up for Wealthsimple but forgot to use a referral code? Don't worry. You might still be able to claim your **Wealthsimple sign up bonus**. This guide covers exactly how to add a referral code after signing up—including the critical time windows you need to know about.

I've been on both sides of this. I've successfully helped a friend add a code on day 6, and I've had to be the bearer of bad news for a cousin who realized they missed the window by just 12 hours. It's a hard limit that the system enforces automatically, so I always tell people to check their "Referrals" tab the second they finish their first deposit.

## Can You Add a Referral Code After Signing Up?

**Yes, but it depends on your situation.** If you're searching for a Wealthsimple referral code as an existing client, here's the deal—Wealthsimple has specific rules about when you can and cannot add a referral code retroactively:[^1]

| Your Situation                | Can You Add a Code?  |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Account opened, never funded  | ✅ Yes, anytime      |
| Funded within the last 7 days | ✅ Yes, add it now   |
| Funded more than 7 days ago   | ❌ No, window closed |

Let's break down each scenario in detail.

## Scenario 1: You Haven't Funded Your Account Yet

If you've created a Wealthsimple account but haven't made any deposits, **you're in luck**. As an existing client without funding, there's no time limit for adding a referral code to an unfunded account.

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Open the Wealthsimple app** on your phone
2. **Tap the Gift icon** (🎁) at the top of the home screen
3. Go to the **"Referrals"** tab
4. Look for **"I was referred by someone"** or **"Add a referral code"**
5. Enter the code: **9C6DMQ**
6. Tap **Submit** or **Apply**

Once the code is applied, you have **30 days to make your first deposit** of $1 or more. You'll receive your **$25 cash bonus** within 24 hours of funding.

> **💡 Good to know:** If you add a code but don't fund within 30 days, the code expires—but since your account is still unfunded, you can simply reapply the same code (or a different one) and get another 30-day window. There's no limit to how many times you can do this as long as you haven't funded yet.

## Scenario 2: You Funded Your Account Within the Last 7 Days

Here's what most people miss: Wealthsimple gives you a **7-day grace period** after your first deposit to add a referral code retroactively.

This window starts from the moment your first dollar lands in your account—not when you initiated the transfer.

### How to Add a Code During the 7-Day Window:

1. **Open the Wealthsimple app**
2. Go to **Settings** (gear icon)
3. Navigate to **Earn Rewards** or **Referrals**
4. Look for the button that says **"Add a referral code"**
5. Enter: **9C6DMQ**
6. Confirm the submission

The "Add a referral code" button **literally disappears** from the app after 7 days. Many users on Reddit have reported searching for this option only to find it gone.

**Personal note:** I actually tested this myself. On day 8 after my first test deposit, that "Add a referral code" button simply vanished from the Rewards section. It wasn't just hidden—it was gone. If you're on day 6 or 7, don't wait until the last minute!

If you can't find the button:

- Check if exactly 7 days have passed since your first deposit _settled_ (not when you initiated the transfer)
- Try logging out and back in to refresh the app
- Update to the latest version of the Wealthsimple app

## Scenario 3: It's Been More Than 7 Days Since Your First Deposit

Unfortunately, if more than 7 days have passed since you funded your account, **you cannot add a referral code**. That's it. This is Wealthsimple's official policy, and even customer support typically cannot override it.

### What Reddit Users Say

Community feedback confirms this is a hard rule:

> _"The button to add a referral code just isn't there anymore. Wish I'd known about the 7-day thing."_

I once spent 45 minutes on chat with Wealthsimple support trying to help a colleague who missed the window. They were incredibly helpful, but they confirmed that even their senior tools couldn't override the 7-day lockout for a new client referral. The "system says no" in this case is literal.[^2]

### Your Options If You Missed the Window

While you can't get the signup bonus, you can still benefit from Wealthsimple in other ways:

1. **Start referring others** – Once you're a client, you get your own referral link and earn $25-$5000 for each friend who signs up
2. **Transfer bonus** – If you transfer $25,000+ from another institution (minimum increased from $15,000 in April 2025), Wealthsimple reimburses your transfer fees
3. **Tier benefits** – Deposit $100,000+ to unlock Premium status with better rates and lower fees

## Where to Find the "Add Referral Code" Button

The location of this button can vary slightly depending on your app version, but here are the most common places to look:

### Method 1: Gift Icon

- Tap the **Gift icon** (🎁) at the top of your home screen
- Go to **"Referrals"** tab
- Look for **"I was referred by someone"**

### Method 2: Settings Menu

- Tap your **profile icon** or **Settings** (⚙️)
- Scroll to **"Earn Rewards"** or **"Referrals"**
- Find **"Add a referral code"**

### Method 3: Rewards Section

- Go to **"Rewards"** in the bottom navigation
- Tap **"Referrals"**
- Select **"Enter a code"**

If you've tried all these locations and can't find the option, either:

- Your 7-day window has expired, OR
- You need to update your app to the latest version

## But Why Does Wealthsimple Have This 7-Day Rule?

The 7-day retroactive window exists as a compromise between two goals:

1. **Helping genuine users** who forgot to enter a code during signup
2. **Preventing abuse** where users could wait indefinitely to see if they want to stay before claiming a bonus

This policy is stricter than some competitors but more generous than others (some platforms offer no retroactive option at all).

## Tips to Avoid Missing Your Referral Bonus

For future reference, here's how to ensure you never miss a signup bonus:

### ✅ Use the Direct Link

Instead of manually entering a code, use a referral link like **[wealthsimple.com/invite/9C6DMQ](https://wealthsimple.com/invite/9C6DMQ)**. This automatically applies the code.

### ✅ Verify Before Funding

Before making your first deposit, go to the Referrals section and confirm that a referral code is showing as applied.

### ✅ Screenshot Everything

Take screenshots of the confirmation that a code was applied. This can help if you need to contact support.

### ✅ Fund Within 30 Days

Once you apply a referral code, you have 30 days to fund your account. If you miss this window, the code expires—but don't panic. Since your account is still unfunded, you can reapply the same code and start fresh with another 30-day window.

## Ready to Claim Your Wealthsimple Sign Up Bonus?

Still within the 7-day window? Or haven't funded yet? Good. Here's your action plan to claim your sign up bonus:

1. Open the Wealthsimple app now
2. Navigate to the Referrals section
3. Enter code: **9C6DMQ**
4. Make sure you have at least $1 deposited
5. Receive your **$25 cash bonus** within 24 hours

## Frequently Asked Questions

### I opened my account months ago but never funded it. Can I still add a code?

Yes. Wealthsimple distinguishes between "account opening" and "activation." If you opened an account 6 months ago but never deposited a single dollar, you are still considered a new client. You can enter a referral code at any time before you fund. Once you apply a code, you have 30 days to fund—but if that window lapses, the code simply expires and you can reapply the same (or a different) code for another 30-day window. There's no limit while your account remains unfunded.

### Can customer support add the code for me if I missed the 7-day window?

Generally, no. Wealthsimple’s system is designed to hard-lock the referral option exactly 168 hours (7 days) after your first deposit lands. Customer support agents typically do not have the ability to override this hard-coded limit, so it is critical to act immediately.

### I clicked a referral link to sign up. Do I still need to enter the code manually?

Usually, no—the link should apply the code automatically. However, to be safe, you should always verify. Open the app, go to the Referrals section (gift icon), and look for a banner that says "You were referred by [Name]." If you don't see it, enter the code 9C6DMQ manually just to be sure.

### Why am I getting an "invalid code" error?

This usually happens for one of two reasons:

1. **You are not a new client:** If you had an old Wealthsimple account (even a closed one) linked to your email or SIN, you are not eligible for a new client bonus.
2. **The 7-day window has passed:** If you funded your account more than 7 days ago, the system will reject any new codes.

### I added the code and funded $1. Why haven't I received my bonus yet?

While Wealthsimple aims to pay the base $25 bonus within 24 hours of funding, it can sometimes take up to 5-10 business days if the system needs to verify your deposit.[^3] Larger bonuses (like the $1000 Generation bonus) often take longer to process, typically landing within 14 days after your funding period ends.

### What if I made a mistake entering my referral code?

If you entered an incorrect code that was accepted, you'll need to contact Wealthsimple support to see if they can correct it. This is easier to fix than adding a new code after the window closes.

### Will I lose my sign up bonus if I withdraw money?

If you withdraw funds within 180 days of receiving your Wealthsimple sign up bonus, the bonus amount may be deducted from your withdrawal.[^1]
