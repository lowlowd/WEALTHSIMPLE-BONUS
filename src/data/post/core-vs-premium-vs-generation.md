faqs:
  - question: 'Can I combine assets with my spouse to reach Generation status?'
    answer: "Yes, through the Wealthsimple Household feature. A Household is limited to 2 people who share the same residential address. Combined totals determine your tier, but members only see the combined total - not each other's individual account balances or activity."
  - question: 'If the market drops my balance below $100k, do I lose Premium status?'
    answer: 'Wealthsimple generally protects you from market downturns. Your status is determined by net deposits OR total portfolio value, whichever is higher. You usually only risk downgrading if you withdraw funds that drop your net deposits below the threshold.'
  - question: 'Do I have to pay the $10 USD fee for each account separately?'
    answer: 'No. The single USD account fee covers all your eligible accounts (TFSA, RRSP, and Non-Registered). If you are Premium or Generation, this fee is waived entirely.'
  - question: 'Is my money locked in if I invest in Private Credit or Private Equity?'
    answer: 'Yes, these assets have different liquidity rules than stocks. They typically have specific monthly or quarterly redemption windows rather than instant selling.'
  - question: 'Do Generation clients still get DragonPass lounge access?'
    answer: 'Yes, but it is part of the Milestone Rewards system. Once you reach the required asset level, you can select the 10 DragonPass lounge visits as your reward for the year.'
  - question: 'Does TFSA + RRSP + Chequing all count toward tier status?'
    answer: 'Yes. All Wealthsimple accounts are combined when calculating your tier.'
  - question: 'Do referral bonuses count toward tier qualification?'
    answer: 'The Wealthsimple sign up bonus itself is cash, not deposits for tier purposes. However, any funds you deposit to receive the bonus do count toward your tier status.'

Wealthsimple isn't just a brokerage—it's actually a tiered ecosystem where your benefits get better as your account grows. As a Core client with two years of experience, I've watched my accounts grow toward that $100K threshold—so I've paid close attention to what each tier actually offers. If you're wondering whether it's worth pushing to hit that $100K or $500K threshold, this breakdown of **Wealthsimple Core vs Premium vs Generation** will help you figure out the real value.

## Quick Tier Overview

| Feature                | Core ($0-$99K)  | Premium ($100K+)   | Generation ($500K+) |
| ---------------------- | --------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| **Management Fee**     | 0.50%           | 0.40%              | 0.20%-0.40%         |
| **Cash Interest**      | 0.75%-1.25%\*   | 1.75%              | 2.25% (max)         |
| **USD Account**        | $10 + tax/month | Free               | Free                |

## Core Tier ($0 - $99,999)

The **Core** tier is where everyone starts—and honestly, it's pretty solid on its own. I've been a Core client since opening my accounts, and while I'm aware of the limitations, it works well for my current needs. Here's what you get when you're just starting out or building up your portfolio:

### What You Get

**Stock & ETF Trading:**

- $0 commission on all Canadian stocks and ETFs
- $0 commission on US stocks and ETFs (with FX caveat)

**Managed Investing:**

- 0.50% annual management fee
- Automatic rebalancing and dividend reinvestment

**Banking:**

- 0.75% base interest on Chequing balance
- Can boost to 1.25% with $2,000+/month direct deposit

**Crypto:**

- 2% trading fee per transaction
- Access to major cryptocurrencies

### The Hidden Cost: USD Trading

Okay, here's the catch for Core users—there's a **1.5% currency conversion fee** every time you touch US stocks.[^1] This is the main limitation I've noticed in my own trading—I've mostly stuck to Canadian ETFs to avoid these fees.

**Example:** Buying $10,000 of Apple stock:

- FX fee: $150 (buy) + $150 (sell) = **$300 round-trip cost**

The workaround? The **USD Account** for $10/month, which lets you hold USD and avoid per-trade conversion.[^1]

For someone trading US stocks monthly, this makes sense:

- Without USD Account: $300+ per trade in FX fees
- With USD Account: $120/year flat fee

### Is Core Good Enough?

**Yes, if you:**

- Only invest in Canadian stocks and ETFs
- Have less than $100K in total assets
- Don't actively trade US equities

**No, if you:**

- Frequently trade US stocks
- Have approaching $100K and want lower fees
- Want higher interest on cash

## Premium Tier ($100,000+)

**Premium** is really the "sweet spot" for serious investors in Canada. Hit $100,000 in net deposits across all your Wealthsimple accounts, and you'll unlock these upgrades automatically.

### What Changes at Premium

**Free USD Account:**

- Saves $120/year immediately
- More importantly, eliminates the need to convert on every US trade

**Lower Management Fee:**

- Drops from 0.50% to 0.40%
- Saves $100/year on a $100,000 portfolio

**Higher Cash Interest:**

- Base rate: 1.75% (vs 0.75%-1.25% for Core)
- With direct deposit: boosted up to the current maximum of 2.25%

**Reduced Crypto Fees:**

- Trading fee drops from 2% to 1%
- Staking reward cut reduced from 30% to 20%

**Better Options Pricing:**

- Per-contract fee drops from $2 to $0.75 USD

**Priority Support:**

- Faster email and phone response times

### Is Premium Worth It at $100K?

Let's do the math for a typical $100K portfolio:

| Benefit                               | Annual Value |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Management fee savings (0.1% × $100K) | $100         |
| Free USD Account                      | $120         |
| Higher cash interest (on $5K cash)    | ~$25         |
| **Total Annual Savings**              | **~$245**    |

**Our take: Premium is absolutely worth it at $100K.** The benefits kick in automatically—you don't have to do anything once you hit the threshold. For most Canadians investing in US stocks, the free USD account alone pays for itself.

If you're close to $100K, consider consolidating accounts to reach Premium faster—it's exactly what I'm planning as my portfolio grows.

## Generation Tier ($500,000+)

**Generation** is Wealthsimple's answer to private banking. It targets high-net-worth individuals who might otherwise use full-service wealth managers.

### What Changes at Generation

**Lowest Fees Possible:**

- Management fee: 0.40% at $500K, scaling down to 0.20% at $10M+
- That's $1,000-$2,000 saved annually on a $500K portfolio

**Maximum Cash Interest:**

- 2.25% rate (the highest available)[^2]
- Note: This is the maximum—Wealthsimple explicitly caps interest at 2.25% and rates cannot be stacked beyond this

**Lowest Crypto Fees:**

- Trading fee: 0.5%
- Staking reward cut: 15%

**Private Asset Access:**

- Private credit funds
- Private equity investments
- **Summit Portfolio** — Wealthsimple's flagship offering for Generation clients, combining public and private assets in a single managed portfolio
- Previously only available to institutional investors with $1M+ minimums

**Lifestyle Perks:**

- 50% off Medcan health plans[^3]
- Partner rewards (Uber One, Strava Premium, etc.)
- Dedicated financial advisor access
- Estate planning services

**Credit Card Benefits:**

- Wealthsimple Visa Infinite annual fee waived ($240/year value)[^4]

### Is Generation Worth Pursuing?

If you're naturally growing to $500K through investing, the benefits are automatic and significant.

**Actively chasing $500K just for Generation status?** That depends:

- Don't move money into worse investments just to hit the threshold
- The math: $500K × 0.1% fee savings = $500/year
- Combined with other perks, Generation clients save $1,000+ annually

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I combine assets with my spouse to reach Generation status?

Yes, through the **Wealthsimple Household** feature.[^5] A Household is limited to 2 people who share the same residential address. Once linked, Wealthsimple combines your total assets to calculate your tier. For example, if you have $300,000 and your partner has $200,000, you will both be upgraded to Generation status and unlock the 2.25% interest rate and other perks.

> **Privacy note:** Household members can only see the combined total—they cannot access each other's individual account balances or activity.

### If the market drops my balance below $100k, do I lose Premium status?

Wealthsimple generally protects you from market downturns. Your status is determined by net deposits OR total portfolio value—whichever is higher. If you deposit $100,000 and the market drops your value to $90,000, you typically maintain Premium status. You usually only risk downgrading if you withdraw funds that drop your net deposits below the threshold.

### Do I have to pay the $10 USD fee for each account separately?

No. If you are a Core client paying for the USD account subscription ($10/month), that single fee covers all your eligible accounts (TFSA, RRSP, and Non-Registered). You do not need to pay per account. If you are Premium or Generation, this fee is waived entirely for all accounts.

### Is my money locked in if I invest in Private Credit or Private Equity?

Yes, these assets have different liquidity rules than stocks. Unlike ETFs which can be sold instantly during market hours, Private Credit and Private Equity funds typically have specific monthly or quarterly "redemption windows." In times of high market stress, there may be limits on how much can be withdrawn at once.

### Do Generation clients still get DragonPass lounge access?

Yes, but it is part of the "Milestone Rewards" system. Once you reach the required asset level, you can select the 10 DragonPass lounge visits as your reward for the year. This is separate from any lounge access provided by the Wealthsimple Visa Infinite Privilege card.

### Does TFSA + RRSP + Chequing all count toward tier status?

Yes. All Wealthsimple accounts are combined when calculating your tier.

### Do referral bonuses count toward tier qualification?

The Wealthsimple sign up bonus itself is cash, not "deposits" for tier purposes. However, any funds you deposit to receive the bonus do count toward your tier status.
