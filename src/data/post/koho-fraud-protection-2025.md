In our digital world, we use our cards for just about everything—from our morning coffee run to online shopping and booking vacations. While this convenience is great, it also makes us think more about security. Hearing stories about fraud can be worrying, and you deserve a financial tool that puts your safety first. Starting with a [secure KOHO referral code](/) gives you control and peace of mind from day one.

While traditional banks have security measures in place, they often feel reactive. You find out about a problem after it has already happened. What if you could stop fraud in its tracks the moment you suspect something is wrong? That's the power behind KOHO's approach to security. As a smart spending and saving account, KOHO is built with advanced fraud protection features designed to keep your money safe. Plus, when you join with a **KOHO promo code**, you're not just getting security; you're getting a head start on your savings.

This guide will walk you through KOHO's fraud prevention tools for 2025, from real-time notifications to instant card locking and virtual cards. We'll show you how these features protect you from unauthorized transactions and help you stay secure, no matter how you spend.

## Your First Line of Defence: A Smarter Account Structure

Before we even get to the high-tech features, it's important to understand how KOHO's basic structure acts as a powerful security tool. Your KOHO account is a reloadable prepaid Mastercard, which means it's not directly connected to your main bank account where you might keep the bulk of your savings.

Think of your main bank account as a vault. You want to keep it as secure as possible. Your KOHO account functions as your everyday wallet. You can load it with the money you need for the week's groceries, your monthly subscriptions, or your travel budget. This makes it incredibly [safe to use while traveling](/blog/koho-referral-code-bonus), as you limit your exposure to just the funds you've loaded.

This separation creates a "firewall" for your finances. In the unlikely event that your KOHO card details are ever compromised, a fraudster could only access the funds you've loaded onto that card. Your main savings account remains untouched and secure. This simple design significantly reduces your risk compared to using a traditional debit card, which is directly linked to your entire chequing account balance.

## Real-Time Notifications: Your Personal Watchdog

One of the most effective ways to spot fraud is to catch it the second it happens. With traditional banking, you might not notice an unauthorized charge until days later when you check your statement, by which time a fraudster could have made several more transactions.

KOHO gives you instant awareness with real-time notifications.

- **How it Works**: The moment a transaction is made with your KOHO card—whether it's you buying lunch or someone else trying to make an unauthorized purchase—you get an immediate notification on your phone.
- **Why it Matters**: This instant alert system means you are always the first to know what's happening with your account. If you get a notification for a purchase you don't recognize, you can take action immediately. It's like having a personal security guard for your wallet, watching over every transaction 24/7.

## Instant Card Locking: Control in the Palm of Your Hand

Have you ever had that heart-sinking feeling when you can't find your card? You're not sure if you left it at a store or if it was stolen. The uncertainty is stressful, and the process of cancelling a card with a traditional bank can be slow. You have to call customer service, wait on hold, and answer a series of questions while a thief could be using your card.

KOHO puts the power to protect your account right in your hands.

- **How it Works**: If your card goes missing, you don't need to call anyone. Simply open the KOHO app and, with a single tap, you can instantly lock your card. This immediately blocks all new transactions.
- **The Peace of Mind**: Once locked, your card is just a piece of plastic. If you find it in your jacket pocket a few minutes later, you can unlock it just as easily. This feature gives you immediate control to secure your account the moment you suspect a problem, offering a level of security and convenience that traditional banking can't match.

## Virtual Cards: The Ultimate Tool for Safe Online Shopping

Shopping online is a huge part of modern life, but it also carries risks. Entering your card details on a website can feel like a gamble, as data breaches are becoming more common.

KOHO offers an elegant and powerful solution to this problem with **Virtual Cards**.

- **How it Works**: A Virtual Card is a unique 16-digit card number, expiry date, and CVV that exists only within your KOHO app. It is completely separate from your physical card. You can use this virtual number for all your online shopping and subscriptions.
- **The Security Benefit**: By using a Virtual Card online, you never expose the details of your physical card to merchants. If a website you shop at suffers a data breach, your physical card remains secure and can still be used for in-store purchases without any worry. You can also lock your Virtual Card at any time, giving you another layer of control over your online spending.

## How KOHO's Fraud Protection Works in Real Life

These features work together to create a secure ecosystem for your money. Let's look at a few examples:

- **Scenario 1: The Phantom Transaction**  
  You're at home watching a movie when you get a notification from KOHO for a $50 purchase at a gas station across town. You immediately know it wasn't you. You open the app, lock your card in seconds, and contact support to report the fraud. The damage is stopped before it can escalate.

- **Scenario 2: The Sketchy Website**  
  You find a great deal on a product from an online store you've never heard of. Instead of risking your main card details, you use your KOHO Virtual Card to make the purchase. You get your item, and your primary card information remains safe and private.

- **Scenario 3: The Lost Card on a Night Out**  
  After a fun night out with friends, you realize your card isn't in your wallet. Instead of panicking, you lock your card through the KOHO app before you even get home. The next morning, you find the card fell under your car seat. You simply unlock it and go about your day. No calls, no waiting for a replacement card.

## Spend with Confidence in 2025
