Saving money is one of those universal goals we all share. Whether you're putting cash aside for a rainy day, a dream vacation, or a down payment on a home, the intention is always there. But let's be honest—actually doing it can be tough. Life gets busy, expenses pop up, and at the end of the month, it can feel like there's nothing left to save. It often feels like you need to be a budgeting expert just to get ahead.

Real Canadians are saving hundreds with KOHO. Start your own savings journey with our [KOHO sign up bonus](/)—get up to $65 value bonus just for joining.

What if saving money didn't have to be so hard? What if it could happen automatically, in the background of your daily life, without you even having to think about it? That's the simple but powerful idea behind KOHO. It's a smart spending and saving account designed to turn the act of saving from a chore into an effortless habit. With its reloadable prepaid Mastercard and innovative app, KOHO is giving Canadians a new way to build their savings and take control of their financial future.

This guide will show you how KOHO's unique features are helping Canadians save more in 2025. We'll explore the tools that make saving feel easy and achievable, and look at how you can use them to reach your biggest financial goals.

## The Challenge: Why Is Saving So Hard?

Before we dive into the solution, it helps to understand the problem. For many people, the biggest barrier to saving is simply getting started. The traditional method of saving requires discipline and manual effort. You have to remember to move money from your chequing account to a separate savings account. If you forget, or if an unexpected expense comes up, your savings plan gets pushed to the side.

Traditional bank accounts don't help much, either. They are passive places to store money, but they don't actively help you save it. They show you a list of transactions, but they don't provide the tools or motivation to change your habits. This is where KOHO changes the game entirely. It's a system designed to build saving directly into your everyday spending.

## RoundUps: Your Secret Savings Weapon

One of KOHO's most popular and effective features is **RoundUps**. It's a simple yet brilliant tool that helps you save money every single time you make a purchase.

Here's how it works: whenever you use your KOHO card, you can choose to have the app automatically round up your purchase to the nearest $1, $2, $5, or $10. The spare change is then instantly moved into your savings.

Think about your daily routine:

- That morning coffee for **$4.50**? Round it up to $5, and **$0.50** goes into your savings.
- Your lunch for **$12.25**? Round it up to $15, and **$2.75** goes into your savings.
- Your grocery bill of **$87.00**? Round it up to $90, and **$3.00** goes into your savings.

Each individual amount is small, so you barely notice it leaving your spendable balance. But over weeks and months, these tiny contributions add up to a significant amount. It's a completely painless and automated way to build a savings fund without changing your spending habits. You're saving money without even trying. For many users, RoundUps become their primary tool for building an emergency fund, proving that small, consistent actions can lead to big results.

## Savings Goals: Turning Dreams into Plans

Saving money is much easier when you have a clear target in mind. A vague goal like "save more" is hard to get excited about. A specific goal like "save $1,000 for a new laptop" is motivating. The KOHO app helps you turn your financial dreams into actionable plans with its **Savings Goals** feature.

Inside the app, you can create one or more dedicated goals for whatever you're saving for:

- A down payment on a car
- A trip to Mexico
- A new couch for your apartment
- An emergency fund for peace of mind

Once you've created a goal, you can start contributing to it. You can move a lump sum of money into your goal, or you can set up automatic contributions. For example, you can tell KOHO to move $25 into your Vacation Fund every Friday. This "set it and forget it" approach ensures you are consistently working toward your goal.

The best part is watching your progress. The app provides a visual tracker that shows you how close you are to reaching your target. This visual motivation makes saving feel like a game you can win, encouraging you to keep going.

## Cashback: Getting Paid to Spend

What if your spending card didn't just help you save, but also gave you money back? That's exactly what KOHO's cashback program does. Unlike a traditional debit card that offers no rewards, KOHO rewards you for your everyday spending.

- **Cashback on Essentials:** With a standard KOHO account, you earn 1% cashback on essential purchases like groceries and transportation.
- **Partner Offers:** KOHO has teamed up with hundreds of popular brands across Canada to offer boosted cashback rates. Before you shop, you can check the app for special offers and earn up to 10% cashback at participating retailers.

Every time you earn cashback, the money is instantly credited to your KOHO account. You can let it accumulate as an extra savings boost or use it toward your next purchase. It's an effortless way to make your money go further. Think of it as a bonus discount on everything you buy, fueling your savings with every tap of your card.

## How It All Comes Together: Real-World Savings

These features don't just exist in a vacuum—they work together to create a powerful savings ecosystem. Here's how a typical KOHO user might be saving more in 2025:

- **Building an Emergency Fund:** A user sets their RoundUps to the nearest $2. Their daily coffee, lunch, and transit pass purchases automatically contribute small amounts to their savings every day. Over a few months, they have built up a $500 emergency fund without even noticing the money was gone.
- **Saving for a Big Purchase:** A couple wants to save $2,000 for a family vacation. They create a Vacation Fund goal in their KOHO app and set up an automatic contribution of $50 every week. They also direct all their cashback earnings into this goal. By using their KOHO card for groceries, they earn cashback that accelerates their progress. In less than a year, they've reached their goal.
- **Debt-Free Holiday Shopping:** Someone wants to avoid post-holiday credit card debt. In January, they create a Holiday Shopping goal and start using RoundUps. By the time November rolls around, they have saved several hundred dollars, allowing them to buy gifts without borrowing money.

## The Future of Saving is Effortless

Saving money shouldn't require complex spreadsheets or extreme self-discipline. The best savings plan is one you can stick to, and the easiest plan to stick to is one that's automated.

KOHO is leading the way by showing Canadians that saving can be simple, rewarding, and even fun. By integrating smart savings tools directly into your daily spending, KOHO helps you build the financial habits that lead to long-term success. It's a system designed to work for you, helping you turn your spare change into a secure future, one transaction at a time.

Stop letting saving be a source of stress. It's time to choose a tool that does the heavy lifting for you.
