## The Big Five: Convenience at a Cost

Canada's major banks—RBC, TD, Scotiabank, BMO, and CIBC—offer full-service banking with branches and ATMs nationwide, plus everything from chequing to mortgages and investments. The tradeoff is often higher monthly fees and complex fee structures for everyday banking.

## Online-Only Banks: Better Rates, Fewer Products

Digital banks like EQ Bank and Tangerine reduce overhead and pass on savings via no-fee accounts and higher deposit rates, but they typically offer fewer in-house products and no branch support for complex issues.

## Where KOHO Fits

KOHO isn't a bank—it's a fintech with a reloadable prepaid Mastercard and a powerful money app focused on day-to-day spending, real-time tracking, and effortless saving. It's built to remove common pain points of everyday banking.

### No Monthly Fees or NSF Surprises

KOHO core accounts have no monthly fees, no e‑Transfer fees, and no interest/overdraft charges because you can only spend what you load, eliminating NSF shocks that can run $45+ at traditional banks.

### Cashback on Everyday Spending

Earn cashback on essentials like groceries and transit, with boosted partner offers and higher tiers available on premium plans. Unlike big banks, KOHO offers a generous sign up bonus for new users.
