- Often come with activation fees
- No rewards or cashback
- Limited to specific merchants (sometimes)
- Can't be reloaded
- No budgeting features

## KOHO's Prepaid Mastercard

KOHO reimagines what a prepaid card can be:

- Reload anytime, as much as you want
- No activation fees
- Earn cashback on purchases
- Accepted anywhere Mastercard is
- Integrated budgeting and savings tools
- Real-time spending notifications

## The Major Advantages of KOHO

### 1. Reloadability

Unlike gift cards that become useless once empty, KOHO can be reloaded instantly via e-Transfer or direct deposit. It's a card you can use forever.

### 2. Earn While You Spend

Traditional prepaid cards offer zero rewards. KOHO gives you cashback on groceries, transportation, and partner merchants—sometimes up to 10%. Most prepaid cards offer nothing. KOHO offers a **promo code** bonus.

## When Might You Still Use a Gift Card?

Gift cards still make sense for:

- Specific merchant promotions
- Teaching kids about money (though KOHO works great for teens)
