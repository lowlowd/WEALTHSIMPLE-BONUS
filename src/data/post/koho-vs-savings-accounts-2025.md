When it comes to growing your savings, you have options. Traditional high-interest savings accounts (HISAs) have been the go-to choice for decades, but modern alternatives like KOHO are changing the game. So which one is right for you in 2025? Why settle for low interest? The [instant KOHO bonus](/) gives you instant value.

## Understanding High-Interest Savings Accounts

Traditional HISAs are offered by banks and credit unions. They typically offer:

- Higher interest rates than regular savings accounts
- CDIC insurance protection
- Limited transactions per month
- Often require minimum balances

## What KOHO Offers

KOHO takes a different approach to savings:

- Competitive interest rates on savings goals
- Integrated spending and saving in one app
- No minimum balance requirements
- Unlimited transactions
- Cashback rewards that boost your savings

## The Key Differences

### Flexibility

**KOHO wins here.** Unlike traditional HISAs that limit monthly transactions, KOHO lets you move money freely between spending and savings without penalties.

### Interest Rates

**It depends.** Some HISAs offer slightly higher rates, but KOHO's cashback rewards can offset the difference—especially if you're an active spender. Compare the interest rates vs the immediate cash from a **KOHO sign up bonus**.

### Accessibility

**KOHO wins.** Everything happens in one app. No need to transfer money between accounts or wait days for funds to clear.

### Features

**KOHO wins.** Beyond just earning interest, you get budgeting tools, instant notifications, and automated savings features like RoundUps. You can even [automate your savings](/blog/koho-spending-control) to grow your wealth effortlessly.

## Which Should You Choose?

**Choose a traditional HISA if:**

- You have a large lump sum to park long-term
- You rarely need to access the money
- You want the absolute highest interest rate

**Choose KOHO if:**

- You want flexibility to spend and save from one account
- You value budgeting tools and real-time insights
- You want to earn cashback while saving
- You prefer a modern, mobile-first experience

## The Best of Both Worlds?

Many Canadians use both: a KOHO account for daily spending and short-term savings goals, and a traditional HISA for long-term emergency funds or larger savings targets.
