    answer: 'No. The standard referral code is ideal for students because it requires only a $1 minimum deposit to trigger the cash bonus.'
  - question: 'Is there a limit to how many friends I can refer?'
    answer: 'No. There is currently no limit to the number of people you can refer to Wealthsimple.'
  - question: 'I signed up but never funded my account. Can I still add a code?'
    answer: 'Yes. If your account has remained unfunded, you can add a code anytime. The 7-day deadline only begins after your first deposit.'

Let's clear this up once and for all. I've helped dozens of friends set up their accounts, and the first question is always: "Do I have a promo code?" I usually have to break the news that unless they're transferring a six-figure inheritance, a referral code is actually what they're looking for.

## Quick Comparison: Promo Code vs Referral Code

| Feature             | Promo Code                              | Referral Code               |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Source**          | Wealthsimple marketing campaigns        | Existing Wealthsimple users |
| **Typical Reward**  | Devices (iPhone, AirPods) or bonus cash | Cash ($25 - $5,000)         |
| **Minimum Deposit** | Usually $100,000+                       | Just $1 [^1] [^2]           |
| **Availability**    | Limited time only                       | Always available            |
| **Stackable**       | Usually not                             | Usually not                 |
| **Best For**        | High-net-worth investors                | Everyone                    |

## What Is a Wealthsimple Promo Code?

A **promo code** (sometimes called a promotional code or campaign code) is basically Wealthsimple running a marketing campaign. Here's the deal with these:

- Run for limited periods (often 4-8 weeks)
- Offer alternative rewards like devices or enhanced cash bonuses
- Typically have higher funding requirements
- Are promoted through official Wealthsimple channels

### Examples of Past Wealthsimple Promotional Campaigns

> **⚠️ Note:** The following are examples based on past promotional campaigns. Device models, deposit thresholds, and hold periods vary by campaign. Always check the current promotion's official terms for the source of truth.

#### Apple Promotion (Example: Holiday Season)

- **Reward:** Latest iPhone or MacBook model
- **Requirement:** Net funding of $100,000 - $500,000 (varies by campaign)
- **Duration:** Limited time during promotional window
- **Registration:** Specific landing page required

#### Device Promotion vs Cash Bonus (General Structure)

- **Reward:** Flagship device (iPhone, MacBook, etc.)
- **Requirement:** Usually $100,000+ deposit
- **Target:** Mass affluent investors considering a platform switch
- **Trade-off:** Extended hold periods (often 1-2 years) may apply

**Personal note:** I actually crunched the numbers on the iPhone 16 promo last year. The 2-year hold period was the biggest dealbreaker for me. Even though an iPhone is worth way more than the referral bonus I’d get normally, I didn't want my principal locked in for 730 days just for a gadget. I preferred the simplicity of the 180-day hold that comes with the standard referral code.

#### Enhanced Referral Bonuses

- **Reward:** Enhanced cash bonus (sometimes $50+ instead of $25)
- **Requirement:** Standard funding requirements
- **Duration:** Short promotional windows
- **Note:** Standard 180-day hold period typically applies

### How Promo Codes Work

1. Visit Wealthsimple's promotional landing page
2. Register specifically through that campaign
3. Meet the higher funding thresholds
4. Receive the promotional reward instead of standard referral bonus

## How to Find Legitimate Wealthsimple Promo Codes

Searching for "Wealthsimple promo code" on Google? Yeah, it can get messy out there. Here's how to find the real deals and avoid wasting your time:

### Official Sources (Always Check First)

1. **Wealthsimple's Promotions Page** — The official [promotions.wealthsimple.com](https://promotions.wealthsimple.com) lists all current campaigns
2. **Wealthsimple's Newsletter** — Subscribers often get early access or exclusive promo codes
3. **In-App Notifications** — Existing users sometimes see targeted promotions within the app

### Secondary Sources (Use Caution)

- **Reddit (r/PersonalFinanceCanada)** — Real user discussions, but verify any codes mentioned
- **Financial Blogs** — Some may have partnerships, others may be outdated
- **Coupon Sites** — Often unreliable for financial products; Wealthsimple rarely uses generic coupon codes

### Red Flags to Watch For

⚠️ **Unrealistic promises** — "Get $500 with just $1" (the referral ladder requires higher deposits for bigger bonuses)

⚠️ **No official source** — If you can't find the promo on Wealthsimple's website, it's likely fake or expired

⚠️ **Requests for personal info** — Legitimate codes never require you to share information outside Wealthsimple's platform

The bottom line? For guaranteed, always-available value, **referral codes beat promo hunting** for most investors. I’ve seen some pretty wild "promo codes" on TikTok promising thousands of dollars for a $10 deposit. Take it from me: if it sounds too good to be true, it’s usually an expired campaign or a complete scam. Stick to the official promotions page.

## Wealthsimple Promo Code History: What Worked in 2025

Understanding past promotions helps you anticipate future opportunities and evaluate current offers:

### Q4 2025: Holiday Season Promotions

- **Apple Promotion (Nov-Dec):** iPhone 17 or MacBook for $100K-$500K deposits
- **New Client Boost:** Enhanced $50 referral bonuses during Black Friday
- **Credit Card Referral Challenge:** Bonuses for new Wealthsimple card signups

### Q2-Q3 2025: Summer Campaigns

- **Transfer Bonus Boost:** Higher bonuses for RRSP/TFSA transfers from Big Five banks
- **Crypto Volume Pricing:** Reduced fees for active crypto traders (not technically a promo code, but a promotional offer)

### Patterns to Watch

| Season            | Typical Promo Type    | Target Audience          |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| January-February  | RRSP deadline promos  | Tax-season investors     |
| April-May         | Tax refund campaigns  | First-time investors     |
| November-December | Premium device offers | High-net-worth transfers |

If you're planning a large transfer, timing it around these promotional windows could maximize your total value. Otherwise, the referral code is available year-round.

## What Is a Wealthsimple Referral Code?

A **referral code** comes from an existing Wealthsimple user and connects you to their account. When you use their code:

- You get a **$25 cash bonus** (flat rate for new users)
- They get a corresponding bonus (which can scale up to $5,000 based on your deposit size)
- Once you're a member, you can earn bigger bonuses by referring others through the referral ladder

### Current Referral Code: 9C6DMQ

👉 **[Use referral code 9C6DMQ](https://wealthsimple.com/invite/9C6DMQ)** – Get $25 with just a $1 deposit.

### How Referral Codes Work

1. Click a referral link or manually enter the code during signup
2. Deposit at least $1 within 30 days
3. Receive your $25 cash bonus within 24 hours
4. Once you're a member, you can refer others and earn up to $5,000 in bonuses yourself

## Can You Stack Promo Codes and Referral Codes?

Often you can stack the standard $25 referral bonus with separate transfer or device promos, but **stacking rules vary by campaign**—always confirm in the current promo's terms.

> **⚠️ Important:** In some recent promotions, deposits used for an iPhone/transfer bonus could not also be counted toward a separate transfer-based offer. Each promotion's combinability is different. Stacking rules vary by campaign, so always confirm in the current promo's fine print.[^6]

### How Stacking Generally Works

1. **Enter the referral code first** — Add code 9C6DMQ in your account settings to qualify for the $25 sign-up bonus
2. **Register for the transfer promotion** — Then register through the promotional landing page for the device offer
3. **Complete the deposit requirements** — Check the specific promo terms to confirm stacking is allowed

### General Stacking Guidelines

| Combination                                | Typically? | Notes                                              |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Referral code + Device promo               | ✅ Often   | Check current promo terms to confirm               |
| Referral code + Transfer bonus             | ✅ Often   | Referral activates with $1, transfer counts total  |
| Referral code + Transfer fee reimbursement | ✅ Yes     | Generally always stackable                         |
| Two transfer-based promos                  | ❌ Rarely  | Same funds typically can't trigger multiple promos |

## So Which Should You Actually Choose?

### Go With the Referral Code If:

✅ You're depositing less than $100,000

- Promo campaigns typically require $100K+ to get device rewards
- The referral code works with just $1

✅ You want guaranteed cash

- Referral bonuses are always cash
- Promo rewards might be devices you don't need

✅ You don't want to wait for promotions

- Referral codes are always available
- Promo campaigns come and go

✅ You value simplicity

- Referral process is straightforward
- Promo campaigns sometimes have complex registration requirements

### Choose a Promo Code If:

✅ You're depositing $100,000+

- The math on device promotions starts to make sense at higher amounts

✅ You specifically want the promotional reward

- If you need a new iPhone and were going to buy one anyway, getting it "free" can be worthwhile

✅ You've already used a referral code before

- If you're somehow not eligible for the referral bonus, a promo might be your only option

## The Math: When Promo Codes Make Sense

Let's calculate when choosing a promo over a referral makes financial sense:

### Scenario: $100,000 Deposit

| Option        | Reward        | Cash-Equivalent Value |
| ------------- | ------------- | --------------------- |
| Referral Code | Cash bonus    | $25                   |
| iPhone Promo  | Latest iPhone | ~$1,500 retail        |

**Winner: Promo code** (if you'll actually use the iPhone and can commit to the 2-year hold period)

### Scenario: $150,000 Deposit

| Option        | Reward        | Cash-Equivalent Value |
| ------------- | ------------- | --------------------- |
| Referral Code | Cash bonus    | $25                   |
| iPhone Promo  | Latest iPhone | ~$1,500 retail        |

**Winner: Promo code** (still makes sense on raw value)

### Scenario: $50,000 Deposit

| Option        | Reward               | Cash-Equivalent Value |
| ------------- | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| Referral Code | Cash bonus           | $25                   |
| Promo Code    | Usually not eligible | $0                    |

**Winner: Referral code** (promo requires higher minimum)

## Current Promotions vs Referral Code

As of December 2025, here's how current known promotions stack up:

| Promotion       | Reward                  | Min. Deposit      | Referral Alternative |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| iPhone Promo    | Latest iPhone (~$1,500) | $100,000          | $25 cash             |
| Apple Promotion | Device varies           | $100,000-$500,000 | $25 cash             |
| Referral Code   | Cash                    | $1                | —                    |

For most users, the **referral code remains the best choice** because:

1. No minimum deposit beyond $1
2. Cash is more flexible than devices
3. No need to time a promotional window
4. The referral ladder still offers substantial bonuses for large deposits

### Hold Period: The "Hidden" Difference

One of the most critical differences between these two options is how long your money must stay in the account. This is often buried in the fine print but can lock up your funds for extended periods.

> **⚠️ Note:** The following table shows typical structures based on past promotions. Actual hold periods, penalties, and liquidity terms vary by campaign—always check the current promotion's official terms.

| Feature             | Referral Code (Cash Bonus) | Promo Code (Device/iPhone)                     |
| :------------------ | :------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| **Bonus Value**     | $25 - $5,000               | Device value (varies by campaign)              |
| **Minimum Deposit** | $1                         | Usually $100,000+                              |
| **Hold Period**     | **180 Days (6 Months)**    | **Varies (often 1-2 years)**                   |
| **Flexibility**     | Standard 180-day hold      | Review promo terms for withdrawal restrictions |
| **Penalty**         | Bonus amount clawed back   | Device cost may be charged (check promo terms) |

**Key Takeaway:** Device promotions typically require longer hold periods than cash referral bonuses. If you may need access to your funds within a year, carefully review the specific promo's terms before committing.[^3]

## Final Recommendation

For the average Canadian opening a Wealthsimple account:

**Use a referral code.** Seriously—it's simpler, it's always there, and you get cash you can do whatever you want with.

👉 **[Sign up with referral code 9C6DMQ](https://wealthsimple.com/invite/9C6DMQ)** and get your $25+ bonus.

Now, if you're moving $100K+ and there happens to be a device promo running that you actually want? Sure, crunch the numbers. But for 95% of Canadians, the referral code wins.

## Promo Codes and Wealthsimple Tiers: What to Know

Here's something worth thinking about—your choice between promo codes and referral codes can also affect which Wealthsimple tier you land in:

### How Tiers Work

| Tier           | Net Deposits | Key Benefits                                            |
| -------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Core**       | $0 - $99,999 | Standard features, 1.5% FX fee on USD                   |
| **Premium**    | $100,000+    | Free USD account, lower management fees                 |
| **Generation** | $500,000+    | Lowest fees, private asset access, lifestyle perks [^7] |

### Strategic Considerations

**If you're close to Premium ($100K):**
The referral ladder gives you $500 cash at $100K. A promo code might give you an iPhone (~$1,500 value). The promo wins on raw value, but the cash bonus is more flexible.

**If you're targeting Generation ($500K):**
At this level, the referral ladder pays $1,500 cash. If a MacBook promo is running (~$2,000+ value), the promo might edge out the referral bonus—but only if you actually need a MacBook.

**Important:** Both promo rewards and referral bonuses are deposited as cash or value to your account, but neither counts as "net deposits" for tier calculation. Your actual deposited funds determine your tier.

## Real User Experiences: What Canadians Are Actually Saying

We spend way too much time on Reddit and Canadian finance forums. Here's what real users report about these codes:

### On Referral Codes

> _"Used a referral code, deposited $50K from my TD TFSA, got $200 bonus plus they covered my $150 transfer fee. Total win."_ — r/PersonalFinanceCanada user

> _"The $1 minimum to get $25 is honestly unbeatable. Just do this even if you're not sure about the platform."_ — r/Wealthsimple user

### On Promo Codes

> _"Got the iPhone 17 promo for transferring my $150K RRSP. Took about 6 weeks for the phone to arrive after my transfer settled."_ — r/PersonalFinanceCanada user

> _"Missed the promo deadline by 2 days. Support couldn't do anything. Should have just used a referral code from the start."_ — r/Wealthsimple user

The consensus? Referral codes are reliable and immediate. Promo codes can offer higher value but require timing and higher deposits.

## Tax Implications of Promo and Referral Bonuses

A frequently overlooked aspect of both promo and referral rewards:

### Cash Bonuses (Referral Codes)

- Deposited to your **Wealthsimple Chequing account** (not registered accounts)
- Wealthsimple does **not** issue T4A tax slips for these bonuses
- You may be responsible for reporting the income, depending on your situation

### Device Rewards (Promo Codes)

- Generally treated as promotional gifts, not taxable income
- Consult a tax professional if receiving high-value items

### Why Bonuses Go to Chequing

If bonuses were deposited to your TFSA or RRSP, they would consume contribution room. By defaulting to the Chequing account, Wealthsimple avoids this complication entirely.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use both a promo code and referral code?

Generally, no. You must choose one entry method when signing up. The same funds cannot trigger both bonuses.

### Do promo codes expire?

Yes. Promotional campaigns run for limited periods (typically a few weeks to a few months). Referral codes are always available.

### How long do I have to keep my money in Wealthsimple?

This is the most important difference to check. Referral bonuses generally require you to keep your bonus and net deposits in the account for **180 days (6 months)**. Promo codes for devices (like an iPhone) often require you to maintain your balance for **1 year or even 2 years** depending on the specific terms.

### Is a Wealthsimple promo code better than a referral code?

For deposits under $100K, the referral code is almost always better (guaranteed cash with just $1 minimum). For deposits over $100K, compare the promo device value to the referral ladder cash bonus.

### What's the best Wealthsimple sign up bonus right now?

For most Canadians, the referral code offering $25-$5,000 in cash (based on deposit size) is the best option. It requires just $1 minimum and is always available.

### Can I refer my spouse or partner living at the same address?

Yes. Wealthsimple permits referrals between members of the same household. As long as your spouse or partner is a new client (meaning they have never held a Wealthsimple account before), you can send them your referral link. Once they fund their account, you will both receive the applicable cash bonus.

### Can I use a referral code when opening a Corporate Account?

Yes, Corporate accounts are eligible for referral bonuses. If you are opening a new Corporate Managed or Self-Directed account, you can apply a code. Note that Wealthsimple typically deposits referral bonuses into a personal non-registered account (like Wealthsimple Cash) rather than the corporate account itself to simplify tax reporting.

### Is there a specific Wealthsimple promo code for students?

Typically, no. Wealthsimple does not offer exclusive "student" codes. However, the standard referral code is ideal for students because it requires only a $1 minimum deposit to trigger the cash bonus. This is much more accessible than seasonal promo codes which often require deposits of $100,000+.

### Is there a limit to how many friends I can refer?

No. There is currently no limit to the number of people you can refer to Wealthsimple.

### I signed up a while ago but never funded my account. Can I still add a code?

Yes. If your account has remained unfunded. The strict 7-day deadline to add a code only begins after you make your first deposit. Look for the "Add a referral code" button in the gift/rewards section of the app. I’ve personally helped a friend use this button after they forgot to add a code during signup—it’s a lifesaver, but keep an eye on that 7-day clock![^1]
