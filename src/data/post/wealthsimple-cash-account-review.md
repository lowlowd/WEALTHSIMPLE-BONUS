The Wealthsimple Cash account (now called "Chequing") has evolved into one of Canada's most competitive everyday banking products. I've been using Wealthsimple Cash as my primary spending account for over two years now, and it's completely changed how I think about everyday banking in Canada. This review covers everything you need to know about interest rates, the prepaid card, and whether it can replace your traditional bank.

## Current Interest Rates (December 2025)

Interest rates on the Wealthsimple Cash account vary based on your client tier and direct deposit status. Keep in mind that the Wealthsimple cash account interest rate fluctuates with the market—specifically, it moves with Bank of Canada rate decisions. As of December 2025 (following the November rate cut), here are the current rates:

| Tier                    | Base Rate | With Direct Deposit\* | Maximum Rate |
| ----------------------- | --------- | --------------------- | ------------ |
| **Core** (under $100K)  | 0.75%     | +0.50%                | **1.25%**    |
| **Premium** ($100K+)    | 1.75%     | +0.50%                | **2.25%**    |
| **Generation** ($500K+) | 2.25%     | —                     | **2.25%**    |

Direct deposit boost requires $2,000+/month deposit from payroll or government payments. The direct deposit boost applies across all chequing accounts (individual and joint). Note: The highest interest rate you can receive is 2.25%—rates do not stack beyond this cap.[^1]

### How This Compares to Big Banks

| Institution      | High-Interest Savings Rate |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| TD               | 0.01% - 0.10%              |
| RBC              | 0.01% - 0.10%              |
| BMO              | 0.01% - 0.10%              |
| Scotiabank       | 0.01% - 0.10%              |
| **Wealthsimple** | **0.75% - 2.25%**          |

Wealthsimple offers **10-100x higher interest** than traditional banks on everyday cash.

### Interest Calculation

- Interest is calculated **daily** on your balance
- Paid out **monthly** to your account
- No minimum balance required to earn interest
- No promotional rate that expires

**Personal note:** One of my favorite notifications is the one I get on the first of the month—seeing the interest deposit land like clockwork is a nice change from my old TD account where I earned practically nothing.

## The Wealthsimple Card

The physical card you receive with your Cash account is a **prepaid Mastercard**—not a traditional debit card. In my experience, it works exactly like any other debit or credit card. I use mine for everything from groceries to online shopping.

### Key Features

**No Foreign Transaction Fees:**
This is the standout feature. Most Canadian credit and debit cards charge **2.5%** on foreign currency purchases.[^2] Wealthsimple charges **0%**.

I recently used my card on a trip to the US, and not having to worry about that 2.5% surcharge on every meal and souvenir made a noticeable difference in my travel budget.

For a $5,000 vacation:

- Traditional bank: $125 in FX fees
- Wealthsimple: **$0**

**1% Cash Back:**
Earn 1% rewards on purchases made with the card.

**Mobile Wallet Support:**
Works with Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Samsung Pay.

**ATM Fee Reimbursement:**
Wealthsimple reimburses ATM fees (up to $5 per transaction) for withdrawals within Canada. Reimbursement typically appears within about 4 business days after the transaction settles.

> **⚠️ Policy Discrepancy:** Wealthsimple's marketing page states "Get ATM fees reimbursed for withdrawals from anywhere in the world," but their help centre policy specifies that ATM fee reimbursements are only for withdrawals within Canada.[^3] It's unclear whether worldwide ATM fees are currently refundable—we recommend confirming with Wealthsimple directly if you plan to use ATMs abroad.

### Limitations

**Not Interac Debit:**
The Wealthsimple card is a prepaid Mastercard, not an Interac debit card. This means:

- ❌ Won't work at merchants that ONLY accept Interac (rare, but some government offices and small businesses)
- ❌ Can't use Interac e-Transfer from the card (use the app instead)
- ✅ Works everywhere Mastercard is accepted (99% of merchants)

**Loading Limits:**
As a prepaid card, there may be limits on how much you can spend in a single transaction. These are generally high enough for everyday use.

## USD Account Features

For users who hold US dollars (for US stock dividends, USD income, etc.), Wealthsimple offers a USD account:

| Feature       | Core      | Premium/Generation |
| ------------- | --------- | ------------------ |
| USD Account   | $10/month | Free               |
| USD Interest  | Limited   | Yes                |
| FX Conversion | 1.5% fee  | 1.5% fee           |

The USD account is particularly useful for:

- Collecting dividends from US stocks in USD
- Avoiding repeated currency conversions
- Traveling to the US frequently

## CDIC Insurance: Up to $1 Million

One of Wealthsimple's strongest features is its deposit insurance structure.

### How It Works

Wealthsimple partners with multiple federally regulated banks to hold your deposits. Each partner bank provides up to $100,000 in CDIC coverage per account type.

By spreading deposits across multiple partner banks, Wealthsimple provides **up to $1,000,000 in CDIC coverage**—10x the standard protection at a single bank.[^4]

### What's Protected

| Account Type  | Coverage                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------- |
| Chequing cash | Up to $1M                 |
| Crypto        | Not covered               |
| Investments   | CIPF up to $1M (separate) |

This makes the Cash account one of the safest places to park large amounts of cash in Canada.

## Private Credit Fund (Generation Tier)

For Generation clients ($500K+), Wealthsimple offers access to private credit investments.[^5]

### What Is Private Credit?

Private credit funds lend directly to businesses, bypassing traditional banks. They typically offer:

- Higher yields than traditional fixed income
- Lower correlation to stock markets
- Regular income distributions

### Risk Considerations

Private credit is **not risk-free**:

- Less liquid than stocks or ETFs
- Default risk on underlying loans
- Not suitable for emergency funds

This product is designed for sophisticated investors who understand the risks and want diversification beyond public markets.

## Who Should Use Wealthsimple Cash?

### Perfect For:

✅ **Emergency funds** — High interest + CDIC protection
✅ **Travel** — No foreign transaction fees
✅ **Everyday banking** — Modern app, instant transfers
✅ **Wealthsimple investors** — Seamless integration with trading accounts

### Maybe Not For:

❌ **People who need Interac-only payments** — Prepaid Mastercard has limitations
❌ **Complex banking needs** — No mortgages, lines of credit, etc.

## Wealthsimple Cash vs. EQ Bank

EQ Bank is another popular high-interest alternative. Here's how they compare:

| Feature                | Wealthsimple Cash | EQ Bank          |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| Interest Rate          | 1.25%-2.25%       | 1.00%-2.75%      |
| Physical Card          | Yes (prepaid)     | Yes (Mastercard) |
| FX Fees                | 0%                | 1.5%             |
| CDIC Coverage          | Up to $1M         | $100K[^6]        |
| Investment Integration | Full              | Limited          |

**EQ Bank wins on:** Slightly higher max rate with direct deposit (2.75% vs 2.25%)

**Wealthsimple wins on:** No FX fees, higher CDIC coverage, investing integration

With recent Bank of Canada rate cuts, both platforms now offer similar interest rates. The choice comes down to whether you value travel-friendly banking (Wealthsimple) or slightly higher savings interest (EQ Bank).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the Wealthsimple Cash interest rate in 2025?

Rates range from 0.75% to 2.25% depending on client status and direct deposit eligibility. Core clients receive 0.75% base, Premium gets 1.75%, and Generation receives the maximum 2.25%. Eligible Core and Premium clients can increase their rate by 0.5% with qualifying direct deposits ($2,000+/month), and this boost applies across all chequing accounts including joint accounts. Important: The highest interest rate you can receive is 2.25%—this is the absolute cap.

### Are there foreign transaction fees?

No. Wealthsimple charges 0% on foreign purchases, making it one of Canada's best travel cards.

### What's the best Wealthsimple sign up bonus?

The best sign up bonus is the referral code **9C6DMQ**—you get $25 cash for just a $1 deposit, plus it goes directly into your Cash account and starts earning interest immediately.

### Can I use the Wealthsimple card at Costco?

Yes! Costco Canada accepts Mastercard, so the Wealthsimple prepaid Mastercard works perfectly there. This is a common question since Costco previously only accepted Amex. I use my physical Cash card at the Costco warehouse near me regularly—it's much more convenient than carrying a separate card just for one store.

### Can I open a Joint Wealthsimple Cash account with my partner?

Yes. Wealthsimple now supports Joint Chequing accounts. You can invite a partner to join your account directly through the app. Both owners will have full access to the funds and can each order their own physical Wealthsimple Cash card.

### Does Wealthsimple reimburse ATM fees charged by other banks?

Yes, for Canadian ATM withdrawals. Wealthsimple reimburses an unlimited number of ATM fees up to $5 each, with reimbursement typically appearing within about 4 business days after the transaction settles.

**Important Policy Discrepancy:** Wealthsimple's marketing page claims ATM fees are reimbursed "for withdrawals from anywhere in the world," but their help centre policy explicitly states reimbursements are only for ATM withdrawals within Canada. It's currently unclear whether worldwide ATM fees are refundable—Canadian withdrawals are definitely covered up to $5 each, but if you're traveling internationally, we recommend confirming with Wealthsimple before relying on ATM fee reimbursement.

### How long do mobile cheque deposits take to clear?

It depends on your instant deposit limit. If your limit is $3,000 and you deposit a $1,000 cheque, the funds are usually available immediately. If you deposit a $10,000 cheque, the first $3,000 is available instantly, and the remaining $7,000 will be held for approximately 5–7 business days to clear.

### Does the Wealthsimple Cash account have overdraft protection?

No. The Wealthsimple Cash account does not offer traditional overdraft protection or credit. If a transaction (like a pre-authorized payment) pushes your balance below zero, you must add funds immediately to resolve the negative balance, or your account may be suspended.

### Will I actually get paid a day early with direct deposit?

In most cases, yes. Traditional banks hold payroll funds until the official "payday" (usually Friday). Wealthsimple releases the funds as soon as they receive the notice from the payment clearing system, which often happens on the afternoon or evening of the previous day (e.g., Thursday).
