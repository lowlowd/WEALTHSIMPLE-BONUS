**Here is the 10-second verdict:**

- **For Lowest Fees:** Choose Newton (best for frequent trading).
- **For Safety & Staking:** Choose Wealthsimple (best for large "buy & hold" portfolios).
- **For Free Bitcoin:** Choose Shakepay (best for daily recurring buys & free withdrawals).

The Canadian crypto scene has evolved. In 2026, you no longer need sketchy offshore exchanges. The choice is now between these three regulated giants. But because fee structures are hidden in spreads, finding the "cheapest" option depends entirely on how you trade.

Here is the honest breakdown of which platform fits your strategy.

## Which Platform Has the Lowest Fees? (Fee Structure Analysis)

**Newton generally offers the lowest trading fees (0.5% - 0.7% spread) for altcoins, while Wealthsimple is transparent but more expensive for small accounts (2% fee).**

Here is the reality behind the numbers: Crypto fees are a headache, and companies love to hide them. While Newton claims "no fees," they make their money on the spread (the gap between the buy and sell price). In my experience trading during high-volatility events, I've seen Newton's spreads widen, but for standard altcoin purchases, they consistently beat Wealthsimple's 2% Core fee.

### Wealthsimple Crypto

Wealthsimple is transparent. They charge an operation fee on every trade. The percentage just depends on how much cash you have with them:

- **Core (Under $100k):** 2% fee
- **Premium ($100k+):** 1% fee
- **Generation ($500k+):** 0.5% fee

**Pros:** You know exactly what you're paying. If you're a Generation client, 0.5% is incredibly cheap for a platform this regulated.
**Cons:** If you're starting small (Core tier), that 2% fee hurts. A lot.

### Newton

Newton claims "no fees". But that's marketing speak. They make money on the spread.

- **Spread:** Usually 0.50% to 0.70% for BTC/ETH, but can be 3-6% for less liquid altcoins
- **Surge Pricing:** Heads up—when the market goes crazy, these spreads can widen.

**Pros:** For the average person just trading altcoins, this is often the cheapest option.
**Cons:** The "no fee" tag is misleading. You are paying a fee; you just don't see it on a separate line.

### Shakepay

Shakepay is the easiest app to use. Period. But you pay for that convenience.

- **Spread:** Typically 1.5% to 2%

**Pros:** They cover withdrawal gas fees. This is huge. I've saved hundreds of dollars in ETH gas fees just by using Shakepay.
**Cons:** Don't day trade here. The fees will eat you alive.

## Can You Earn Rewards? (Staking & Rewards)

**Yes. Both Wealthsimple and Newton now offer staking (ETH, SOL, ADA, DOT), while Shakepay offers free Bitcoin daily via "ShakingSats."**

My personal strategy: I actually split my approach here. I use Wealthsimple for my "serious" staking because it's one-click and the most regulated. But I still open Shakepay every single morning to shake my phone. I'm currently on a 400-day shaking streak, and while it's only a few cents a day, those free ShakingSats have accumulated enough to cover my coffee habit.

If you're holding for the long run, you might as well get paid for it.

### Wealthsimple Crypto: The Staking King

Wealthsimple lets you stake Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and Polkadot.

- **Yield:** Varies (currently ~3-5% for ETH).
- **Convenience:** It's one click. Seriously.
- **Cost:** They take a cut (30% for Core, 15% for Generation), but frankly, avoiding the technical headache of on-chain staking is worth it for most people.

### Shakepay: The "ShakingSats" Phenomenon

Shakepay doesn't do staking. But they have ShakingSats.

- **How it works:** Open the app. Shake your phone. Get free Bitcoin.
- **The catch:** You need a referral code to unlock it.
- **My take:** It sounds silly, but I do it every morning. I've been on a 400-day shaking streak myself. It's small amounts, sure. But over a year? It's basically "free" Bitcoin for a 2-second morning habit.

### Newton: Now Offers Staking

Newton launched staking in late 2025, now supporting ETH, SOL, ADA, ATOM, DOT, NEAR, and SUI.

- **Yield:** Varies by asset.
- **Convenience:** Easy in-app staking.
- **Competition:** Now directly competes with Wealthsimple for stakers.

## Can You Withdraw to a Private Wallet? (Free vs Paid)

**Shakepay is the clear winner here because they cover all withdrawal gas fees (making it free), whereas Wealthsimple and Newton charge standard network fees.**

Why this matters for your wallet: I use Shakepay as my primary "on-ramp" specifically because of this feature. I've saved hundreds of dollars in ETH gas fees just by buying on Shakepay and immediately moving it to my Ledger. If you buy $50 of Bitcoin on Wealthsimple and try to move it, the network fee might eat a chunk of it. On Shakepay, you get the full value.

| Platform              | Withdrawal Cost                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Shakepay** (Winner) | FREE - They pay the miner fees |
| **Newton**            | You pay network fees           |
| **Wealthsimple**      | You pay standard network fees  |

## The Verdict: Which Platform is For You?

Like I said, there isn't one winner. It depends on you.

I personally keep my "buy and hold" stack on Wealthsimple for the cold storage insurance, but I execute my trades on Newton to save the 1.5% difference.

### Choose Wealthsimple Crypto if:

You want it all in one place. If you already check Wealthsimple for your RRSP and stocks, seeing your crypto right next to it is just convenient. It's also the clear winner for high-net-worth investors who get those low fees, or anyone who wants staking rewards without the stress. Keep in mind that unlike your stocks, crypto is not protected by CDIC insurance.[^2]

### Choose Newton if:

You're hunting for altcoins. Maybe you want SOL or DOT but don't have $100k for Wealthsimple Premium. With 70+ coins and tight spreads, Newton is the sweet spot for the average Canadian trader who wants variety without getting gouged.

### Choose Shakepay if:

You're a Bitcoin or Ethereum purist. And you love self-custody. The free withdrawals make it the perfect place to buy your BTC and immediately move it to your hardware wallet. Use the referral code, unlock ShakingSats, and get your free daily stats. It's a no-brainer.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Which platform is safer?

They're all solid. Wealthsimple Crypto is a CIRO-registered dealer—that's the gold standard for regulation here.[^1] Newton and Shakepay are registered with FINTRAC. Wealthsimple uses Gemini for custody with $200M insurance,[^3] which gives me a lot of peace of mind. As someone who remembers the QuadrigaCX collapse, the fact that Wealthsimple is a CIRO-registered dealer provides a level of security that I just don't feel with non-regulated exchanges.

### How long does it take to unstake my crypto on Wealthsimple?

For Ethereum, there is a warm-up and unbonding period that can take several days to weeks depending on network congestion (usually a queue + ~27 hours). You won't be able to sell these assets until that period is over. So it's not instant.

### Why can't I buy USDT (Tether) on Wealthsimple?

Tether (USDT) is the world's most popular stablecoin, but it is effectively banned on regulated Canadian platforms.[^4] Wealthsimple is a fully compliant restricted dealer under the OSC, meaning they only list approved assets like USDC.

### How do I get my crypto tax documents from Wealthsimple?

Unlike some platforms that require complex API keys, Wealthsimple provides a dedicated "Crypto Realized Gain Loss Report" (CSV) in the app's documents section. I found it incredibly easy to just download this file and upload it directly to Koinly for my taxes.

### Is there a limit on how much crypto I can withdraw to my wallet on Wealthsimple?

Yes, there is a limit. For security, the wealthsimple crypto withdrawal limit daily is typically set around $10,000 CAD equivalent (or $25,000 weekly).[^5] This is important for "whales" or anyone moving large sums to self-custody. Competing platforms like Newton or Shakepay may have different limits, so check this if you plan to move high volumes frequently.
