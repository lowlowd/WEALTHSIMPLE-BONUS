## How the Wealthsimple Referral Program Works

Honestly, Wealthsimple's referral program is one of the better ones you'll find in Canadian fintech. It's straightforward. The payout is genuinely quick. And the process? Dead simple. Here's how the whole thing works:

### Step 1: Sign Up Using a Referral Link

When you click a referral link (like the one above), you're automatically connected to the referrer. No need to manually enter anything.

### Step 2: Fund Your Account with $1+

You only need to deposit **$1 or more** within 30 days of opening your account. This can go into any eligible account:

- Self-directed Trading
- Managed Investing (Robo-advisor)
- Crypto
- Chequing account

### Step 3: Receive Your $25 Bonus

Here's the nice part—your cash bonus typically shows up in your Wealthsimple Chequing account within 24 hours. Most people get it the same day. Some within a few hours. Seriously.

## The Referral Ladder: Earn Up to $5,000

Here's something a lot of people miss—Wealthsimple doesn't just give you $25 and call it a day. They've got this **tiered bonus structure** called the "Referral Ladder Challenge" that runs through December 31, 2025. The more you deposit, the bigger your bonus gets.

Here's the full breakdown:

| Your Deposit Amount | Your Bonus |
| ------------------- | ---------- |
| $1 – $999           | $25        |
| $1,000 – $9,999     | $50        |
| $10,000 – $49,999   | $100       |
| $50,000 – $99,999   | $200       |
| $100,000 – $499,999 | $500       |
| $500,000 – $999,999 | $1,500     |
| $1,000,000+         | $5,000     |

If you're moving a decent-sized portfolio from one of the big banks, this ladder can mean **thousands of dollars in free cash**. Not a bad deal for paperwork you'd be doing anyway, right?

## Transferring From a Big Bank? What You Need to Know

Many Canadians claiming the referral bonus are moving their investments from TD, RBC, BMO, Scotiabank, or CIBC. Here's what to expect:

### Transfer Fee Reimbursement

Most banks charge $135-$150 + tax to transfer out. Wealthsimple reimburses this fee if:

- You transfer **$25,000 or more**
- The transfer completes successfully
- You keep funds in Wealthsimple for 90 days

| Your Situation | Referral Bonus | Transfer Fee Reimbursement | Total Value |
| -------------- | -------------- | -------------------------- | ----------- |
| $25K transfer  | $100           | ~$150                      | **~$250**   |
| $50K transfer  | $200           | ~$150                      | **~$350**   |
| $100K transfer | $500           | ~$150                      | **~$650**   |

### Bank-Specific Tips

**TD Bank:** Keep $160+ cash in your TD account to cover the transfer fee. TD won't process the transfer if you don't have enough cash to pay their fee.

**BMO with Mutual Funds:** BMO's proprietary mutual funds can't transfer "in-kind" to Wealthsimple. They'll need to be sold first, which could create a tax event in non-registered accounts.

**RBC/Scotiabank/CIBC:** Generally straightforward. Expect 2-4 weeks for the full transfer process.

### The 90-Day Extended Window

For institutional transfers (RRSP, TFSA, LIRA, etc.), Wealthsimple gives you a **90-day window** instead of 30 days to complete the transfer and qualify for the referral ladder. This acknowledges the reality that bank transfers can be slow.

## Wealthsimple Referral Code for Existing Clients

One of the most common questions we get is: **"I already signed up but forgot to use a referral code. Is it too late?"** If you're an existing client looking for a Wealthsimple referral code, here's the breakdown:

### If You Haven't Funded Your Account Yet

Good news! You can still add a referral code at any time before making your first deposit. Here's how:

1. Open the Wealthsimple app
2. Tap the **Gift icon** at the top of the screen
3. Go to the **"Referrals"** tab
4. Select **"I was referred by someone"**
5. Enter the code: **9C6DMQ**

### If You've Already Funded Your Account

You have a **7-day window** after your first deposit to add a referral code retroactively. After 7 days, the option disappears from the app entirely.

To add the code during this window:

1. Open the Wealthsimple app
2. Navigate to **Settings > Earn Rewards > Add a referral code**
3. Enter: **9C6DMQ**

⚠️ **Important:** After 7 days, the system will reject any referral code attempts. This is a strict policy, and even customer support typically cannot override it.

## Why Canadians Are Switching to Wealthsimple

Understanding why others have made the switch can help you decide if it's right for you. Here's what makes Wealthsimple stand out for the average Canadian investor:

### The Fee Advantage

| What You're Doing        | Traditional Bank          | Wealthsimple                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Buy $5,000 of RBC stock  | $9.95+ commission         | $0                          |
| Hold USD from dividends  | Often poor exchange rates | Free USD account (Premium+) |
| Managed portfolio ($50K) | 1%+ fees                  | 0.4-0.5%                    |
| High-interest savings    | 0.01-0.10%                | 1.25-2.25%                  |

For a typical investor making 2-3 trades per month with $50K invested, switching to Wealthsimple can save $300-500 annually—not including the referral bonus.

### Mobile-First Experience

Wealthsimple consistently ranks as the top-rated financial app in Canada. The interface is designed for everyday investors, not traders who need Bloomberg terminals. Features include:

- Clean portfolio overview
- One-tap stock purchases
- Instant deposits from linked banks
- Real-time notifications for price movements

### The All-in-One Ecosystem

What really sets Wealthsimple apart is the integration. Your investments, banking, crypto, and taxes all live in one place:

- **Transfer between accounts instantly** (no waiting for wire transfers)
- **See your complete financial picture** in one dashboard
- **Tax time is simplified** with automatic imports to Wealthsimple Tax

This integration is why starting with the referral bonus makes sense—even if you only use one feature now, you'll have access to everything as your needs grow.

### The Wealthsimple vs Questrade Question

If you're comparing platforms, here's the quick version:

| Feature                 | Wealthsimple                | Questrade                  |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Commission**          | $0                          | $0 (as of 2025)            |
| **Currency conversion** | 1.5% (or free with Premium) | 1.5% (or Norbert's Gambit) |
| **Mobile app**          | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐                  | ⭐⭐⭐                     |
| **Sign up bonus**       | $25+ referral code          | Varies                     |
| **Banking integration** | Full Cash account           | None                       |

For most Canadians, especially those under $100K in assets, Wealthsimple offers the better overall experience. At higher asset levels, Questrade's Norbert's Gambit gives it an edge for USD trading—but Wealthsimple is adding this feature in 2026.

## Wealthsimple Promo Code vs Referral Code: Which Is Better?

If you've been searching for a "Wealthsimple promo code" or "Wealthsimple sign up bonus," you've probably noticed two types of codes floating around. Here's the honest breakdown:

|                         | Wealthsimple Promo Code         | Referral Code       |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Source**              | Seasonal campaigns              | Existing users      |
| **Reward Type**         | Often devices (iPhone, AirPods) | Cash ($25+)         |
| **Funding Requirement** | Usually $100K+                  | Just $1             |
| **Availability**        | Limited time                    | Always available    |
| **Stacking**            | Usually not stackable           | Works independently |

### Why Most Canadians Should Use a Referral Code

From what we've seen here in Canada, the **standard referral code is the better choice** for everyday investors because:

- The $1 minimum is achievable by anyone looking for a Wealthsimple sign up bonus
- Cash is more flexible than the devices offered in promo campaigns
- It's always available—no rushing to meet promotional deadlines

### When a Wealthsimple Promo Code Makes Sense

That said, if you're transferring $100,000+ and Wealthsimple is running one of their device promotions (like the iPhone or MacBook deals), the promo code might actually beat the referral bonus in terms of total value. We break down exactly when each option wins in our detailed comparison.

## How Much Can You Really Earn? Real Examples

Let's run through some realistic scenarios as a Canadian investor:

### Scenario 1: Just Getting Started ($1 deposit)

- **Your Wealthsimple sign up bonus:** $25 cash
- **Time investment:** 5 minutes to sign up
- **Return:** Essentially infinite (free money for $1)

### Scenario 2: Moving Your TFSA ($50,000 transfer)

- **Your referral bonus:** $200 cash
- **Transfer fee reimbursement:** ~$150 (if your bank charges)
- **Total immediate value:** $350
- **Promo alternative:** Not eligible for most device promos at this level

### Scenario 3: Consolidating Retirement Accounts ($500,000 transfer)

- **Your referral bonus:** $1,500 cash
- **Transfer fee reimbursement:** ~$150
- **Total immediate value:** $1,650
- **Promo alternative:** Could get an iPhone (~$1,500 value) but you'd miss the cash bonus

Based on user reports, most people prefer the cash—but if you were already planning to buy that iPhone, the Wealthsimple promo might be worth considering.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will I receive my Wealthsimple sign up bonus?

Your $25 cash bonus is typically deposited within 24 hours of making a qualifying deposit of $1 or more. From what we've seen, most users get it the same day.

### Can I use a referral code if I already have a Wealthsimple account?

Only if you've never funded any account before. If you've already made a deposit, you have exactly 7 days to add a referral code retroactively.

### I’ve used Wealthsimple Tax before. Am I eligible for the sign up bonus?

Yes, in most cases. Wealthsimple's terms define a "New Client" as someone who has not previously opened a Wealthsimple Investing, Crypto, or Chequing account. If you have only ever used Wealthsimple Tax (formerly SimpleTax) to file your return, you are likely still eligible for the $25 bonus when you open and fund your first asset account.

### Can I use a referral code to open a Corporate Account?

Yes, Corporate Accounts are eligible for referral bonuses. However, because Wealthsimple Corporate accounts do not always have "Chequing" features enabled, the referral bonus is typically deposited into the personal non-registered account of the authorized trader associated with the corporation.

### Can I refer my spouse if we live at the same address?

Yes. You can refer friends, family, and spouses even if they live in the same household. As long as the person you are referring is a new client (has never funded a Wealthsimple account), you will both receive the cash bonus.

### Where does my referral bonus go?

Bonuses are deposited into your Wealthsimple Chequing account, not your investment accounts. This prevents any impact on your TFSA or RRSP contribution room.

### Can I stack a Wealthsimple promo code with a referral code?

Generally, no. You have to choose one or the other when signing up. The same funds can't trigger both bonuses.

### Can I refer my friends after signing up?

Yes! Once you're a Wealthsimple client, you get your own referral link and can earn $25 for each friend who signs up and deposits $1+. There's no limit to how many people you can refer.
