Tax season is stressful. But it doesn't have to be expensive. **Wealthsimple Tax** (formerly SimpleTax) is a free, CRA-certified tax preparation software that handles everything from simple T4s to complex investment income.

I’ve used Wealthsimple Tax for the last three years, and it’s the only time of year I actually look forward to checking my finances. Moving from a paid software that charged me per slip to a pay-what-you-want model was a breath of fresh air—and yes, I do actually donate because the time saved is worth it. Here's our complete 2025 review.

## What Is Wealthsimple Tax?

Wealthsimple Tax is a web-based tax preparation and filing service that:

- Is **completely free** (pay-what-you-want donation model)
- Is **CRA NETFILE certified** for electronic filing[^1]
- Handles both simple and complex returns
- Integrates directly with Wealthsimple investment accounts

### The "Pay What You Want" Model

Unlike TurboTax or H&R Block, Wealthsimple Tax has no mandatory fees. After completing your return, you're invited to donate what you think the service is worth—including $0.

| Plan      | Cost                   | Returns | Features                        |
| --------- | ---------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Basic** | $0 (optional donation) | 2       | Full tax filing capabilities    |
| **Plus**  | $40 + tax              | 8       | Priority support, audit defense |
| **Pro**   | $80 + tax              | 9+      | Expert review, 1-on-1 advice    |

Most users never need more than the free Basic tier. Seriously. The Basic tier is identical in features to the paid plans for the vast majority of Canadians.

## Key Features

### Auto-Fill from CRA

Wealthsimple Tax can automatically import your tax slips directly from the CRA. This includes:

- T4 (Employment income)
- T5 (Investment income)
- T3 (Trust income)
- RRSP contribution receipts
- And more

Simply connect your CRA My Account, and most of your slips are imported instantly.

**Personal note:** The first time I used the CRA Auto-fill, I was braced for it to fail. Instead, it pulled in all 12 of my T4s and T5s in about 30 seconds. I spent more time double-checking for errors than I did actually entering data.

### Investment Integration

Here's where Wealthsimple Tax shines for investors:

**Direct Wealthsimple Import:**
If you have Wealthsimple trading accounts, your trading activity is automatically imported, including:

- Capital gains and losses
- Foreign income (dividends from US stocks)
- Cryptocurrency transactions
- Adjusted Cost Base (ACB) calculations

**The Crypto Advantage:**
Calculating crypto taxes manually is notoriously complex. Wealthsimple Tax auto-imports your Wealthsimple Crypto transactions and calculates ACB automatically—a feature that could save you hours.

I trade both stocks and crypto, and the automatic ACB (Adjusted Cost Base) calculation is a lifesaver. Before this, I was maintaining a massive, complex spreadsheet that I never quite trusted. Seeing the Gains/Losses sync perfectly from my Wealthsimple Trade account was the moment I was sold.

### Comprehensive Tax Situations

Wealthsimple Tax handles:

✅ Employment income (T4)
✅ Self-employment income
✅ Rental property income
✅ Investment income (dividends, capital gains)
✅ Cryptocurrency gains and losses
✅ RRSP deposits and withdrawals
✅ Child and family benefits
✅ Student loans and tuition credits
✅ Moving expenses
✅ Medical expenses
✅ Charitable donations

### Refund Optimization

The software includes tools to maximize your refund:

**Pension Income Splitting:**
Automatically suggests the optimal split between spouses.

**Spousal Dividend Claims:**
Identifies when transferring dividends benefits your family tax position.

**Carryforward Amounts:**
Tracks unused tuition credits, capital losses, and donation amounts from previous years.

**RRSP Optimizer:**
Shows exactly how RRSP contributions will impact your refund.

### 100% Accuracy Guarantee

Wealthsimple Tax guarantees that if you owe penalties or interest due to a calculation error they made, they'll pay the difference.[^2]

## New for 2025

### Tax Video Walkthroughs

New video guides walk you through different sections of your tax return.

### Guided Tax-Filing

A new assistant helps build a template based on your specific situation.

### CRA Payments Integration

If you owe taxes, you can now add the CRA as a payee directly in your Wealthsimple Chequing account.

## Limitations

### No Dedicated Mobile App

The previous mobile app was discontinued. You can still access Wealthsimple Tax through your mobile browser, but it's optimized for desktop.[^3]

### Support Limitations

Free users only have email support. Live chat and phone support are reserved for Plus and Pro subscribers.

### Return Limits by Plan

The number of returns you can file depends on your plan:

- **Basic (free):** 2 returns
- **Plus ($40):** 8 returns
- **Pro ($80):** 9+ returns

This may be a consideration if you're doing taxes for many family members.

### Quebec Complex Returns

While Quebec returns are supported, some very complex Quebec-specific situations may not be fully covered.

### No T3 Trust Returns

If you're an executor handling an estate, note that Wealthsimple Tax supports the final T1 return for a deceased individual, but does **not** support T3 Trust Income Tax returns for the estate itself.[^4] You'll need separate software or an accountant for that.

## Wealthsimple Tax vs. TurboTax

| Feature                    | Wealthsimple Tax         | TurboTax          |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------- |
| **Base Price**             | Free                     | $0-$200+          |
| **Investment Integration** | Automatic (Wealthsimple) | Manual import     |
| **Crypto Calculation**     | Automatic ACB            | Limited           |
| **Support**                | Email (free tier)        | Chat/phone (paid) |
| **Mobile App**             | Browser only             | Dedicated app     |
| **CRA Auto-fill**          | Yes                      | Yes               |

**Wealthsimple Tax wins on:** Price. Crypto handling. Investment integration.

**TurboTax wins on:** Mobile app experience, live support access

For Wealthsimple investors, Wealthsimple Tax is the obvious choice due to seamless integration.

## Options Trading and Taxes

For options traders, tax filing can be complex. Wealthsimple Tax imports your options trading activity and categorizes gains/losses appropriately.

**What's Tracked:**

- Premium received from writing options
- Gains/losses from buying and selling options
- Assignment and exercise transactions

**Reddit Feedback:**
Users on r/PersonalFinanceCanada and r/CanadianInvestor report that Wealthsimple Tax handles options better than most retail tax software, though complex multi-leg strategies may require manual review.

## The Investment Account Referral Opportunity

Tax season represents a unique opportunity to convert Wealthsimple Tax users into investors.

**The Funnel:**

1. Use Wealthsimple Tax (free)
2. Receive your tax refund
3. Invest the refund in Wealthsimple Trade
4. Claim a $25 referral bonus on top

If you're getting a refund anyway, depositing it into a TFSA with Wealthsimple and earning a bonus is one of the smartest moves you can make.

👉 **[Sign up for Wealthsimple with code 9C6DMQ](https://wealthsimple.com/invite/9C6DMQ)** and get a $25 sign up bonus when you deposit your refund.

## How to Use Wealthsimple Tax

### Step 1: Create an Account

Go to [wealthsimple.com/tax](https://wealthsimple.com/tax) and sign up (or log in with your existing Wealthsimple account).

### Step 2: Import Your Data

Connect to CRA My Account to auto-import slips. If you have Wealthsimple investments, these import automatically.

### Step 3: Complete Your Return

The guided interface walks you through each section. Use the search bar to find specific slips or deductions.

### Step 4: Review and File

Review your calculated refund/balance. File electronically through NETFILE.

If you found the service valuable, you're invited to donate—but there's no obligation.

I usually choose to donate about $20 because I find the crypto tax reporting and automatic integrations so valuable that it feels worth it. However, you can absolutely file for free without any guilt—there’s zero obligation to pay, and you get the exact same features either way. It’s significantly better than the "Basic" packages from competitors who often tack on fees for things like RRSP slips.

## Is Wealthsimple Tax Right for You?

### Perfect For:

✅ **Wealthsimple investors** — Seamless integration
✅ **Crypto traders** — Automatic ACB calculation
✅ **Budget-conscious filers** — Truly free
✅ **Self-employed individuals** — Handles business income
✅ **Students** — Tracks tuition and education credits

### Maybe Not For:

❌ **People who need phone support** — Only email for free tier
❌ **Highly complex situations** — May need professional accountant
❌ **Quebec residents with very complex returns** — Some limitations

## Final Verdict

So here's the deal. Wealthsimple Tax is arguably the best free tax software in Canada.

For Wealthsimple investors in particular, the automatic import of trading activity, crypto calculations, and ACB tracking makes tax season significantly less painful.

And when you receive that refund? Consider investing it and claiming a **$25 referral bonus**.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Wealthsimple Tax really free?

Yes. You can complete and file your entire return for $0. The donation at the end is completely optional.

### Can I file in Quebec?

Yes, Wealthsimple Tax supports both federal and Quebec provincial returns.

### Does it handle cryptocurrency?

Yes, and it's one of the best free options for crypto. If you trade crypto on Wealthsimple, your ACB and gains/losses are calculated automatically.

### Does Wealthsimple Tax handle the T1135 form for foreign assets?

Yes. If you hold foreign property with a total cost of over $100,000 CAD, Wealthsimple Tax fully supports Form T1135. It will guide you through using either the Simplified Reporting Method (Part A) or the Detailed Reporting Method (Part B) depending on your asset value.[^5]

### Can I file a final return for a deceased person?

Yes, Wealthsimple Tax supports the preparation and filing of a Final Return (T1) for a deceased individual. However, note that it does not currently support T3 Trust Income Tax returns, which may be required for the estate itself.

### Is the "Plus" plan with Audit Protection worth it?

The free version already includes a 100% accuracy guarantee on calculations. The "Audit Protection" in the Plus plan pays for a tax expert to defend you and correspond with the CRA if your return is reviewed. For simple T4 returns, it is likely unnecessary. For self-employed individuals or those with rental income, the $30 fee may be worth the peace of mind.

### Can I file taxes for previous years (catch-up filing)?

Yes, but only back to the 2020 tax year. Wealthsimple Tax does not support filing for years before 2020. If you need to file for 2019 or earlier, you'll need to use paper forms and mail them to the CRA.[^6]

### Where do I find my NETFILE Access Code?

Your NETFILE Access Code (NAC) is an 8-character code located on the top right corner of your previous year's Notice of Assessment from the CRA. Entering this code verifies your identity and allows you to use the "Auto-fill my return" feature to automatically import your T4s, T5s, and RRSP slips.
