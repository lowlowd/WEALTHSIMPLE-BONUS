Tax season is stressful. But it doesn't have to be expensive. **Wealthsimple Tax** (formerly SimpleTax) is a free, CRA-certified tax preparation software that handles everything from simple T4s to complex investment income. Here's our complete 2025 review.

## What Is Wealthsimple Tax?

Wealthsimple Tax is a web-based tax preparation and filing service that:

- Is **completely free** (pay-what-you-want donation model)
- Is **CRA NETFILE certified** for electronic filing
- Handles both simple and complex returns
- Integrates directly with Wealthsimple investment accounts

### The "Pay What You Want" Model

Unlike TurboTax or H&R Block, Wealthsimple Tax has no mandatory fees. After completing your return, you're invited to donate what you think the service is worth—including $0.

| Plan     | Cost                   | Features                        |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Free** | $0 (optional donation) | Full tax filing capabilities    |
| **Plus** | $29.99                 | Priority support, audit defense |
| **Pro**  | $89.99                 | Expert review, 1-on-1 advice    |

Most users never need more than the free tier. Seriously.

## Key Features

### Auto-Fill from CRA

Wealthsimple Tax can automatically import your tax slips directly from the CRA. This includes:

- T4 (Employment income)
- T5 (Investment income)
- T3 (Trust income)
- RRSP contribution receipts
- And more

Simply connect your CRA My Account, and most of your slips are imported instantly.

### Investment Integration

Here's where Wealthsimple Tax shines for investors:

**Direct Wealthsimple Import:**
If you have Wealthsimple trading accounts, your trading activity is automatically imported, including:

- Capital gains and losses
- Foreign income (dividends from US stocks)
- Cryptocurrency transactions
- Adjusted Cost Base (ACB) calculations

**The Crypto Advantage:**
Calculating crypto taxes manually is notoriously complex. Wealthsimple Tax auto-imports your Wealthsimple Crypto transactions and calculates ACB automatically—a feature that could save you hours.

### Comprehensive Tax Situations

Wealthsimple Tax handles:

✅ Employment income (T4)
✅ Self-employment income
✅ Rental property income
✅ Investment income (dividends, capital gains)
✅ Cryptocurrency gains and losses
✅ RRSP deposits and withdrawals
✅ Child and family benefits
✅ Student loans and tuition credits
✅ Moving expenses
✅ Medical expenses
✅ Charitable donations

### Refund Optimization

The software includes tools to maximize your refund:

**Pension Income Splitting:**
Automatically suggests the optimal split between spouses.

**Spousal Dividend Claims:**
Identifies when transferring dividends benefits your family tax position.

**Carryforward Amounts:**
Tracks unused tuition credits, capital losses, and donation amounts from previous years.

**RRSP Optimizer:**
Shows exactly how RRSP contributions will impact your refund.

### 100% Accuracy Guarantee

Wealthsimple Tax guarantees that if you owe penalties or interest due to a calculation error they made, they'll pay the difference.

## New for 2025

### Tax Video Walkthroughs

New video guides walk you through different sections of your tax return.

### Guided Tax-Filing

A new assistant helps build a template based on your specific situation.

### CRA Payments Integration

If you owe taxes, you can now add the CRA as a payee directly in your Wealthsimple Chequing account.

## Limitations

### No Dedicated Mobile App

The previous mobile app was discontinued. You can still access Wealthsimple Tax through your mobile browser, but it's optimized for desktop.

### Support Limitations

Free users only have email support. Live chat and phone support are reserved for Plus and Pro subscribers.

### 20 Return Limit

The free version allows up to 20 returns per account—plenty for most people, but a limit for those doing taxes for many family members.

### Quebec Complex Returns

While Quebec returns are supported, some very complex Quebec-specific situations may not be fully covered.

### No T3 Trust Returns

If you're an executor handling an estate, note that Wealthsimple Tax supports the final T1 return for a deceased individual, but does **not** support T3 Trust Income Tax returns for the estate itself. You'll need separate software or an accountant for that.

## Wealthsimple Tax vs. TurboTax

| Feature                    | Wealthsimple Tax         | TurboTax          |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------- |
| **Base Price**             | Free                     | $0-$200+          |
| **Investment Integration** | Automatic (Wealthsimple) | Manual import     |
| **Crypto Calculation**     | Automatic ACB            | Limited           |
| **Support**                | Email (free tier)        | Chat/phone (paid) |
| **Mobile App**             | Browser only             | Dedicated app     |
| **CRA Auto-fill**          | Yes                      | Yes               |

**Wealthsimple Tax wins on:** Price. Crypto handling. Investment integration.

**TurboTax wins on:** Mobile app experience, live support access

For Wealthsimple investors, Wealthsimple Tax is the obvious choice due to seamless integration.

## Options Trading and Taxes

For options traders, tax filing can be complex. Wealthsimple Tax imports your options trading activity and categorizes gains/losses appropriately.

**What's Tracked:**

- Premium received from writing options
- Gains/losses from buying and selling options
- Assignment and exercise transactions

**Reddit Feedback:**
Users on r/PersonalFinanceCanada and r/CanadianInvestor report that Wealthsimple Tax handles options better than most retail tax software, though complex multi-leg strategies may require manual review.
